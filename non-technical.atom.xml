&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1: Why is product-led growth of rising&amp;nbsp;importance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;) strategy that relies on using
   your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product-Led Growth (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt;) means that every team influences the product:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing - how can our products generate a demand&amp;nbsp;fly-wheel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales - how can we use the product to qualify our prospects for&amp;nbsp;us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Success - how can we create a product that helps customers become
  successful beyond our&amp;nbsp;dreams?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having every team focussed on the product, you create a culture that is
   built around enduring customer&amp;nbsp;value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By leading with the product throughout the org, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; companies get&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shorter sales&amp;nbsp;cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower Customer Acquisition Costs&amp;nbsp;(CACs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher Revenue Per Employee (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPE&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy is an action plan that specifies how a company will reach
   target customers and achieve a competitive&amp;nbsp;advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to select a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;, you first need to understand:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market&amp;nbsp;conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;competitive&amp;nbsp;positioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ideal&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;product&amp;nbsp;offering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing these elements will help you choose the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; that will
   acquire, retain and grow you customer base in the most capital-efficient&amp;nbsp;way &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sales-Led Go-To-Market&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Centers: Sales, Marketing, Customer&amp;nbsp;Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost Centers: Engineering,&amp;nbsp;Product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual Contract Value (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACV&lt;/span&gt;) can be very&amp;nbsp;high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise first solutions that are very complex and therefore need a
high-touch sales&amp;nbsp;model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Total Addressable Market (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt;) is very small, because your market
is super niche, you can quite easily talk to almost all market
participants. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; is built for large&amp;nbsp;TAMs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s great for new categories of product where education is required,
because you need to change how people approach a problem. This takes time
and requires education.
This is turn requires that you understand your customers pain points,
objections, core problems. If you jump to quickly a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy then
you risk a high church rate because you haven&amp;#8217;t understood or educated
your customers well&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales cycles are very&amp;nbsp;long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Life Time Value (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTV&lt;/span&gt;) must be high enough to recoup the investment in
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;. This often requires charging the customer a premium. This premium
  price isn&amp;#8217;t because the product is amazing, or more valuable to the
  customer, but because the customer acquisition model is more&amp;nbsp;expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a Sales-Led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;, you need to watch out for competitors who can
  sell more efficiently, or have a more efficient Customer Acquisition
  Model. They can steal your market share by offering the same product with
  at a lower&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Acquisition methods are super leaky. Most marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) never result in a closed deal, this is partly because:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it encourages markets to gate content in order to hit their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MQL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;goals    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it focusses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent.
  (but reading a white-paper or brochure doesn&amp;#8217;t mean im going to buy
  the&amp;nbsp;thing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the entire process rewards creating friction in the buying&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, there is often a disconnect between marketing and&amp;nbsp;sales &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Product-Led Go-To-Market&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching from Sales-Led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; to Product-Led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; creates a defensive&amp;nbsp;moat &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product led marketing team asks &amp;#8220;How can we use the product to qualify our
prospects for&amp;nbsp;us?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product led customer success team asks &amp;#8220;How can we create a product that
  helps customers be successful without our&amp;nbsp;help?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product-led engineering team asks &amp;#8220;How can we create a product with a quick&amp;nbsp;time-to-value?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth is much faster, because:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need fewer resources to&amp;nbsp;scale, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the top of the customer funnel is much&amp;nbsp;wider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt; is much&amp;nbsp;lower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPE&lt;/span&gt; (revenue per&amp;nbsp;employee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience is&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 - Free, Freemium or&amp;nbsp;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOAT&lt;/span&gt; framework to pick the right &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;arket Strategy - Dominant? Disruptive?&amp;nbsp;Differentiated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;cean Conditions - Blue or&amp;nbsp;Red?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;udience - Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing&amp;nbsp;strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime to Value - How much time do you need for a customer to
  experience the&amp;nbsp;value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant - Do it better than the competition &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; charge a lower&amp;nbsp;price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt; big&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at lower
cost than anyone else on the&amp;nbsp;market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the user realize significant ongoing value quickly with little or no&amp;nbsp;help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to be the undisputed market&amp;nbsp;leader?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiated - Pick and win a fight against an industry giant &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main line of defense against the giant is&amp;nbsp;specialization &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on an underserved&amp;nbsp;niche&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a specific job better than the competition but charge significantly&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not a one-size-fits-all&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free trials and demos work well&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because its specialized, combining freemium with quick time-to-value is&amp;nbsp;difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main competitive advantage is how you solve your customers&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your market have underserved&amp;nbsp;customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt; big&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACV&lt;/span&gt; high&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could prospects experience a Magic Moment during a free&amp;nbsp;trial?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disruptive - Charge less for an inferior product (e.g. Canva, Google docs)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a simpler product that solves a specific pain point, and because
  its simpler, its faster, you can charge less, and its more appropriate to
  some over-served or priced-out&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a scaled-down&amp;nbsp;product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs must be&amp;nbsp;low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product must be easy to&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt; large&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can on-boarding be completely&amp;nbsp;self-service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freemium model&amp;nbsp;thrives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3 - Red-Ocean or Blue-Ocean&amp;nbsp;markets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-ocean companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a larger
share of the existing market. As the market gets crowded, opportunity for
profit and growth reduces. Products become commodities. Cut-throat competition
turns the waters&amp;nbsp;red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue-ocean companies access untapped market space and create demand. They have
opportunity for highly profitable growth. Competition is irrelevant. Create and
capture new&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some markets will be red-ocean, but a particular niche within it will be blue&amp;nbsp;ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Oceans require educating the customer to create the demand. This is
high-touch, and often a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy isn&amp;#8217;t going to work. It needs to be
sales-led in order to educate the customer enough. But if Time-To-Value (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTV&lt;/span&gt;)
is short then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; could be&amp;nbsp;great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Oceans need big wide funnels in order to compete, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategies
work great. They&amp;#8217;re defensible, keep costs low and make sales cycles&amp;nbsp;short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4 - Top-Down or Bottom-Up selling&amp;nbsp;strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; works for&amp;nbsp;bottom-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High touch sales-led strategies work for Top-Down enterprise sales strategies, where the product is super complex and the sales cyccle is very&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-Down (Sales team is the growth&amp;nbsp;engine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower customer&amp;nbsp;churn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor revenue&amp;nbsp;distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long sales&amp;nbsp;cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Trial sometimes&amp;nbsp;works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom-Up (Product is the growth&amp;nbsp;engine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wider&amp;nbsp;top-of-funnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictable sales&amp;nbsp;figures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue&amp;nbsp;diversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable&amp;nbsp;fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small contracts&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-paying&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expertise&amp;nbsp;shortage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upfront investment as non-paying customers drain&amp;nbsp;resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freemium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free-Trial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5 -&amp;nbsp;Time-to-Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time until you deliver on your promise to&amp;nbsp;prospects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time until the product sells&amp;nbsp;itself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategies require fast&amp;nbsp;time-to-value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rank your uses across 2 dimensions and group into 4 quadrants. The
   dimensions are Ability (low - high) and Motivation (low - high)&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Motivation - Low Ability = Mission&amp;nbsp;Impossible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Motivation - Low Ability =&amp;nbsp;Rookie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Motivation - High Ability =&amp;nbsp;Veteran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Motivation - High Ability =&amp;nbsp;Spoiled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out your top two quadrants. Unless all your users are Spoiled, you
   need to decrease&amp;nbsp;Time-To-Value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How motivated are your&amp;nbsp;users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your product easy for your target audience to&amp;nbsp;use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can users experience the core value (magic moment?) without&amp;nbsp;hand-holding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 2 - Build Your&amp;nbsp;Foundation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 7 - Build a product-led&amp;nbsp;foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positive feedback loop:
1. &lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt; your value
2. &lt;strong&gt;Communicate&lt;/strong&gt; it
3. &lt;strong&gt;Deliver&lt;/strong&gt; on your promise
4.&amp;nbsp;Repeat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 8 - Understand your&amp;nbsp;value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re selling live-chat software, you&amp;#8217;re not really selling live-chat
software, you are selling a new and better way to acquire&amp;nbsp;customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are selling the outcome, the result, the&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain makes us want to change so that we can avoid or prevent the pain&amp;nbsp;altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is product&amp;nbsp;agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why people buy a&amp;nbsp;product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional Outcome - the core task that needs to get&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Outcome - how a customer wants to feel or avoid feeling as a
result of the functional&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Outcome - how a customer wants to be perceived by others by using
   your&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every software, there are usage patterns that point towards to core outcomes
that are most important to&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest differences between sales-led and product-led companies is
that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SL&lt;/span&gt; companies monitor usage patters to see if users are accomplishing
meaningful outcomes. These outcomes are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;value-metrics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A value-metric is the way you measure value exchange in your product&lt;/strong&gt;. They
are the linchpin to successful execution of a product-led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy because
you are aligning your revenue model directly with your customer acquisition
model. Because your value metrics play a vital role in how you price your
product, set up your monitoring, and build your&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value metrics could&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for vimeo, number of videos uploaded by the&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for slack, number of messages sent by the&amp;nbsp;user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for paypal, amount of revenue generated by the user&amp;nbsp;(processed?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;functional&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;outcome based&lt;/strong&gt; value metrics. Functional value
metrics are &amp;#8220;per user&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;per 100 videos&amp;#8221;. Pricing scales around functions of
usage. Outcome based value metrics charge based on the outcome, e.g. how many
views a video received, or how much money a customer made when using your
payment process&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many SaaS companies rely on feature differentiation as a way to justify higher
prices, but this produces higher&amp;nbsp;churn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value metrics outperform feature differentiation with upto 75% less churn&amp;#8230;
Outcome based value metrics reduce church by an additional 40%.&amp;nbsp;Apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good value metric is easy for a customer to understand. They need to immediately understand what they&amp;#8217;re paying for and where they fit in your packing/pricing structure. If you&amp;#8217;re in an established market, it makes senses to look at what the competition&amp;nbsp;charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good value metric is aligned with the value that the customer receives through the product. Consider the low-level components of your high-level outcome. E.g. what low level actions are necessary to get the end result?  Sending lots of messages? Meeting lots of people? Finding lots of&amp;nbsp;things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good value metric grows with your customers usage of the valuable outcome.
   If customers get incredible value from the product, charge them more because
   the product is worth it. Also, if they aren&amp;#8217;t getting much value from the
   product, charge them&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t do user based pricing if you want to get lots of users - its a conflict
   of&amp;nbsp;interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re small, you can try different pricing strategies and iterate to&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask&amp;nbsp;yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do my best customers&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do my best customers not&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What features did my best customers try first when they were&amp;nbsp;on-boarding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the similarities along my best customers that led to&amp;nbsp;success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For churned customers, what were the main differences between them and the
   best customers? Were they in the ideal audience? Why did they church? What
   did they do or not do that good customers&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overview:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask good&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid bad&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it&amp;nbsp;casual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push for commitment and&amp;nbsp;advancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frame the meeting&amp;nbsp;well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the right, tight, customer&amp;nbsp;segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prep well, take good notes, review your&amp;nbsp;notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1 - Opinions are worthless, you want objective facts about what happened in the&amp;nbsp;past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out if people care about your idea by never mentioning&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing yourself not to mention your idea will force you to ask better&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your questions pass the mom test:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about their lives, not your&amp;nbsp;idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask about specifics in the past, not&amp;nbsp;hypotheticals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend most of your time listening, not&amp;nbsp;talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an overly optimistic&amp;nbsp;lie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 - Avoid bad data - Compliments, Fluff, Hypotheticals,&amp;nbsp;Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and they aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to tell you what to&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3 - Ask the Important Questions - You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you ask in each&amp;nbsp;conversation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search out the scary questions you&amp;#8217;ve been unintentionally avoiding. What&amp;#8217;s the worst thing a prospect could say?
What&amp;#8217;s the scariest question you could&amp;nbsp;ask? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good way to find scary questions is to imagine that your company has failed and then to ask&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get an unexpected answer to one of your questions and it doesn&amp;#8217;t have any effect on what you&amp;#8217;re going to do, then was it really worth asking&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General advice for hard things including asking hard questions - imagine you were delegating the task, what would you tel the person to do? That&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ask about&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love bad news - if you find out that your idea is fundamentally flawed you&amp;#8217;ve just saved a tonne of time and energy
and money. Move on. It&amp;#8217;s getting you closer to the&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad news isn&amp;#8217;t the result of an opinion. No one knows if your idea will work, only the market knows. Opinions don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lukewarm response to your idea can be a great conversation, because you realise that your idea isn&amp;#8217;t a great idea.
Lukewarm means they don&amp;#8217;t care enough to buy the first (worst) version before it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look before you zoom. Don&amp;#8217;t focus on details too soon, you need to understand the big picture&amp;nbsp;first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;product risk&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;customer risk&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product risk&lt;/strong&gt; - can I build it and grow&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer risk&lt;/strong&gt; - is there a big enough group of people who are going to buy&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-plan a list of the 3 most important questions (including a scary one) before every meeting or conversation. Be ready with these. They should change from week to week. As you get good quality answers to existing questions you can bring in new&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4 - Keep it casual, Structure: Problem -&amp;gt; Solution -&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Sales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normally you would have 3 meetings with a client in order to make a big sale. This lets you do each stage really well without blurring the data:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify your prospect&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain your&amp;nbsp;solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell the&amp;nbsp;solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying a problem doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be a meeting, keep it casual and you will get more honest feedback much
faster. It works better as a&amp;nbsp;chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It take 5 minutes (max) to identify if a problem exists and is&amp;nbsp;important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give as little info as possible about your idea whilst still nudging the conversation&amp;nbsp;along&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5 - The currencies of conversation - Time, Reputation,&amp;nbsp;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In early stage sales, the main goal is learning. Money is a&amp;nbsp;side-effect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone is willing to risk reputation, or spend time or money on your idea, then you can believe that they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing a compliment is still useful - it means they&amp;#8217;re trying to get rid of&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If its a bad meeting, push for a commitment of some kind. Ask them to spend time, reputation or money and you&amp;#8217;ll see what they really&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they aren&amp;#8217;t excited (not just interested, but in pain and excited for your solution) then you need to find that out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s still a good meeting if you can discover&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lead isn&amp;#8217;t a real lead until you&amp;#8217;ve given them a concrete chance to reject&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask learning questions by using the Mom Test, then confirm by selling&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need &lt;strong&gt;crazy customers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a painful and expensive&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They know they have a painful and expensive&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have the money to pay you to solve&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They already have their own bad solution to this terrible problem, and yours is clearly&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crazy customer doesn&amp;#8217;t say &amp;#8220;yeah that&amp;#8217;s great, im really intersted, let me know when its ready&amp;#8221;. They say &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AHHH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIFE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PAY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;!&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crazy customer will front you the money when all you have is a prototype made of&amp;nbsp;duct-tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crazy customer is the person reading you blog, searching for workarounds, when you haven&amp;#8217;t spent loads of marketing and lead&amp;nbsp;generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a crazy customer close - they&amp;#8217;ll stick with you when times are&amp;nbsp;tough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 6 - Finding good conversations - Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new&amp;nbsp;stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it&amp;#8217;s a topic you both care about, find an excuse. You&amp;#8217;ll both enjoy the chat. You don&amp;#8217;t need to mention your idea if it breaks the&amp;nbsp;premise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm introductions are the ideal way to start a new conversation. 6 degrees of freedom in the world, so find someone who knows someone who knows&amp;nbsp;someone..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold calls - LinkedIn,&amp;nbsp;maybe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serendipity - be prepared, be&amp;nbsp;bold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a good excuse -&amp;nbsp;hustle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landing pages so that googling the problems brings them to&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise an event - bring the businesses together for an event. You&amp;#8217;ll be considered an expert cos you&amp;#8217;re
facilitating&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become a subject matter&amp;nbsp;expert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking and teaching engagements - you get to have strong opinions, and you&amp;#8217;ll be&amp;nbsp;respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision -&amp;gt; Framing -&amp;gt; Weakness -&amp;gt; Pedestal -&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 7 - Choosing you&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups don&amp;#8217;t starve, they drown. In options, choices, ideas. You get&amp;nbsp;overwhelmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a good customer segment, focus on it, and don&amp;#8217;t get&amp;nbsp;distracted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the beginning:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - PhD&amp;nbsp;students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPal -&amp;nbsp;eBay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evernote  - Moms with recipes,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will look obvious with hindsight, probably not so obvious before you&amp;#8217;ve figured it out&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;#8217;t get a consistent answer to a question, maybe you&amp;#8217;re speaking to different&amp;nbsp;segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you aren&amp;#8217;t finding &lt;strong&gt;consistent problems and goals&lt;/strong&gt; then you don&amp;#8217;t have a specific enough customer segment&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the group, which type of person would want it the&amp;nbsp;most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would everyone within the group want to buy/use it? Or only&amp;nbsp;some?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does the subset want&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does everyone in the group have the same&amp;nbsp;motivation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other motivations are&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who else (outside the group) have these&amp;nbsp;motivations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for &lt;strong&gt;Who-Where&lt;/strong&gt; pairs of segments. &amp;#8220;Finance professionals who run&amp;nbsp;marathons&amp;#8221;..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want customers who are reachable, profitable, and personally&amp;nbsp;rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good segments are usually &amp;#8220;who-where&amp;#8221; pairs. If you don&amp;#8217;t know where to find your customers, keep slicing until you
do. Make sure the segment is reachable, profitable, and personally&amp;nbsp;rewarding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 8 - Getting the most from the conversations by prepping and&amp;nbsp;reviewing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare well&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you 3 big questions ready, including the scary&amp;nbsp;ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know who you are speaking&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know what commitment and next-steps you want to push&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend up to an hour &lt;strong&gt;writing down your best guesses about what you think they will say, what they care about and what they want.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a focussed segment, you&amp;#8217;ll only need to do this&amp;nbsp;occasionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whilst prepping, if you come across a question which can be answered using the internet, use the&amp;nbsp;internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take good notes&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask if you can record the&amp;nbsp;audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record emotions as well as words. Verbatim alone isn&amp;#8217;t always accurate 6 months&amp;nbsp;later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use shorthand for follow up, happy, angry, meh,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pains and obstacles are a lot more important if someone is embarrassed or angry when they&amp;#8217;re talking about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dig into the big emotions, find out what&amp;#8217;s causing them, or why its a big&amp;nbsp;deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review your notes&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta - which questions went well or&amp;nbsp;not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were the answers to the scary&amp;nbsp;questions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you do better next&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were the clear signals? What signals did you&amp;nbsp;miss?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to do better marketing, understand your value and differentiators&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what makes a best-fit&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning is a fundamental input to every business tactic you&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you fail at positioning, you fail at marketing and&amp;nbsp;sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning is &amp;#8220;conext setting&amp;#8221; for&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers need to be able to easily understand&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What your product&amp;nbsp;does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why it is&amp;nbsp;special&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why it matters to&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your prospects can&amp;#8217;t figure out what your product does quickly, they will invent a position for you. It might hide your key strengths or misunderstand your&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find people to demo your product to, then ask them to describe it back to you. Do the same with existing customers. If they&amp;#8217;re not saying the same thing then you have a positioning&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products with strong positioning:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the best kind of&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the value&amp;nbsp;obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell&amp;nbsp;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positioning as&amp;nbsp;context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without positioning to guide us, we don&amp;#8217;t know how to understnad a&amp;nbsp;product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning lets us make assumptions about&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who a product is&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what its main features&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much it&amp;nbsp;costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without it we would be paralyzed by choice, and we wouldnt be able to make sense of all the products around&amp;nbsp;us. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The context and purpose of a product from the founders/engineers perspective are often different to those of the&amp;nbsp;prospect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prodcuts can be positioned in multiple ways, and often the best positioning is not the default&amp;nbsp;positioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad positioning makes it harder for prospects to figure out if your product is worth thinking&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning requires considering:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers point of view - what problem/pain does it&amp;nbsp;solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ways your product is uniquely&amp;nbsp;different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characteristics of a potential&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best market context to make your value uniquely&amp;nbsp;obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Five (plus one) components of effective&amp;nbsp;positioning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Alternatives - if you didnt exist, what would your customers use instead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its what your prospects would use to do the task if your product didnt exist. It could be excel, or pen and paper. It could be nothing, (in which case maybe you product doesnt solve a real pain&amp;nbsp;point.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably know a lot more about your market, and problem, and alternative solutions, than your prospects do. (&amp;#8220;Doing nothing&amp;#8221; could be an opportunity, not a red&amp;nbsp;flag.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its important to understand what customers will compare your product with, because this is how they will define &amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221;. Is it &amp;#8220;easier&amp;#8221; than a pen and&amp;nbsp;paper?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers might never have purchased a solution like yours&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Attributes - What do you have that alternative do not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could be:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery Model (online vs offline, installed on-site vs&amp;nbsp;not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business model (rental vs&amp;nbsp;purchase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific expertise (data scientist with financial and back-end web dev&amp;nbsp;expertise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value (and quantifiable objective proof) - What value do the attributes enable for customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If unique attributes are your secret sauce, the value is why someone might care about your secret&amp;nbsp;sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fact based, provable, demonstrable, quantifiable, objective. 3rd party oppinions are&amp;nbsp;relevant. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target market characterists - Who cares a lot about that value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on customers who are most likely to purchase quickly, wont ask for discounts, will tell their friends about&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should clearly identify who these are&amp;nbsp;and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identidy what sets them apart from other groups of customers. why are they uniquely likely to buy from you when others wouldnt or would take longer to consider and make a&amp;nbsp;purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Category - What context makes your value obvious to the ideal customer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declaring that your product exists in a certain market triggers a powerful set of&amp;nbsp;assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make these assumptions help you, not hinder&amp;nbsp;you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When presented with your product, customers will try to use what they already know to figure out what your product is all about and why its special. You want them to be able to do this really quickly and&amp;nbsp;easily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make these assumptions work for you, not against you. You won&amp;#8217;t have to list every feature, because most of them will be assumed by the context of the market&amp;nbsp;category. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get it right, and sales efforts (copy) wont be wasted battling those assumptions, but can instead build off of them to show secret sauce and value more&amp;nbsp;obviously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Bonus) Relevant Trends - what trends make your product relevant right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used carefully, trends can show prospoects why they should pay attention to your product right now. Increases&amp;nbsp;urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can increase urgency, excitement, coolness,&amp;nbsp;credibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but the trend must be directly relevant, practically and objectively&amp;nbsp;applicable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blockchains, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ML&lt;/span&gt; are trends - they are relevant to multiple&amp;nbsp;markets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these components is relevant to the&amp;nbsp;others&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Entrepreneurship"></category><category term="marketing"></category><category term="positioning"></category><category term="startups"></category><category term="book"></category></entry><entry><title>How I learnt toÂ code</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/How-I-learnt-to-code.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-01T13:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-12-01T13:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2020-12-01:/How-I-learnt-to-code.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;4 years ago I started learning how to code, and it was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult! It&amp;#8217;s still difficult, but I now have a collection of tools and perspectives that make it less daunting (more on that below). Leveling up requires one more
abstraction to wrap my head around, or one more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to understand. I can do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#8217;t think it needed to be so difficult, so now I&amp;#8217;m building &lt;a href="https://codeschoolmeta.com"&gt;Code School Meta&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to learn how to&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to code has been fun, ultimately successful, and life changing (hello job security!) but at the beginning it was sooo slow, and super&amp;nbsp;tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling like an imposter, and thinking that I was definitely not a real developer - I hadn&amp;#8217;t taken any classes in computer science. I felt like I knew almost nothing about&amp;nbsp;anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process began with Pandas, a (&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) Python analytics library. Spreadsheets were slowing me down at work, and I was bored. I found this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw"&gt;great tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by Brandon Rhodes. From there I found out about Jupyter Notebooks, and then I found about Github pages and how to make a blog using &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; (and also JavaScript, which I tried very hard to avoid for as long as possible). I felt like a monkey bashing a keyboard as I tried to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; elements do what I&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git was next, but I found this &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu/rys-git-tutorial.html"&gt;amazing tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to help me learn. It made Git seem &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, and also helped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; make more sense too.&amp;nbsp;Bonus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suddenly realized that great learning materials are crucial if I was going to keep momentum and keep on enjoying the thrill of seeing the computer do something I hadn&amp;#8217;t made it do&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#8217;m now working on &lt;a href="https://codeschoolmeta.com"&gt;Code School: Meta&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s an online community to make it easier to teach yourself how to code - less confusion about how to get started or what to learn next, more encouragement, and lots of high quality&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marketing has three&amp;nbsp;phases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before (prospect) - get people to know you and indicate&amp;nbsp;interest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During (lead) - get the to like you and buy from you for the first&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After (customer) - get them to trust you, buy from you regularly, and refer new&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt;, all the other things are &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jargon free definition of&amp;nbsp;marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt; - The circus is coming to town, you paint a sign saying &amp;#8220;Circus coming to town on&amp;nbsp;Saturday&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotion&lt;/strong&gt; - Put the sign on the back of an elephant and walk it into&amp;nbsp;town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publicity&lt;/strong&gt; - Walk the elephant through the mayors flower beds and let a newspaper write about&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public relations&lt;/strong&gt; - Get the mayor to laugh about&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales&lt;/strong&gt; - the town people go to the circus, you explain how much fun the entertainment is, they buy some tickets, you answer their questions, they spend lots of money on food, games,&amp;nbsp;shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing&lt;/strong&gt; is the plan that made the whole thing&amp;nbsp;happen&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Entrepreneurship"></category><category term="Marketing"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning toÂ market</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/marketing-101.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-19T12:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-11-19T12:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2020-11-19:/marketing-101.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve learnt many things this year by being a solo technical founder, but so far marketing isn&amp;#8217;t one of them. I&amp;#8217;m trying to change&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since April I&amp;#8217;ve been able to work full time as a solo founder. I&amp;#8217;ve challenged myself to build something useful enough that customers would want to
pay for it and in the process of seeking that goal I&amp;#8217;ve become a much better
and more rounded&amp;nbsp;developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working solo for about 7 months now, and in that time I&amp;#8217;ve begun
using test driven development, I&amp;#8217;ve built non-trivial data driven web apps
using Django, and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt how to deploy and monitor those apps in
production and make them&amp;nbsp;performant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made two main apps; &lt;a href="https://moneybar.nl"&gt;moneybar.nl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pippip.email"&gt;pippip.email&lt;/a&gt;,
and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt so&amp;nbsp;much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m realising though, that I still have much to learn in other spheres. Being a
great developer is deeply meaningful to me. It&amp;#8217;s literally a bucket list item
for me and I intend to be writing code as long as I live. But there is no point creating products if no one knows they&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where marketing and positioning comes in. Right now it feels like I know nothing about how to get
users, or validate an idea, or position a product. These are all super necessary and super&amp;nbsp;unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more meta level, I&amp;#8217;m confronted with the lost benefits of working with co-foudners, or of having friends doing similar things. I want to work faster and
make progress more efficiently. I need to be part of a&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in isolation does have its advantages, though. I&amp;#8217;m self-taught and
self-directed, figuring out the contours of uncharted territory and creating my own
personal map. In my mind, I have a deep and almost personal relationship with the coding
abstractions and tools I&amp;#8217;ve learnt to work with. Classes and functions, strings and
floats, literally have (to me) their own textures, colors and weights when I
think or dream about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like I can pick up these abstractions as if they were
physical objects and turn them around to examine them. Place them next to each
other and compare the differences. Run thought experiements. In my experience,
this kind of relationship and affection simply doesn&amp;#8217;t happen when taking a
class or following someone elses schedule.
It&amp;#8217;s satisying to feel ownership of a skill like this, and it&amp;#8217;s one of the
primary reasons I consider coding to be similar to a&amp;nbsp;craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, now that I realise I need to validate my product,
position it, and figure out marketing, I&amp;#8217;ve stopped writing code, put down my
tools, and I&amp;#8217;m going to learn marketing. I&amp;#8217;ve bought some books. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll post some reviews here&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no particular order here is what I plan to&amp;nbsp;read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 weeks ago I had an idea for a product whilst reading a news&amp;nbsp;article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if the writing and sending of important messages could be
separated, so that I could write something long before I needed to send it, and
know that then sending would happen at the right time without having to think
about it. This could be useful for sending my daughter a message on her 15th
birthday, or to my wife on our 10th anniversary. I also designed a check-in
mechanism, so that messages could be sent if I disappeared or pass&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://PipPip.email"&gt;PipPip&lt;/a&gt; is the result - event-driven and scheduled email delivery, from days to&amp;nbsp;decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re working on validating the idea and finding the right niche&amp;nbsp;audience. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Entrepreneurship"></category><category term="PipPip"></category></entry><entry><title>BetweenÂ Clients</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/between-clients.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-08T16:05:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-08T16:05:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2019-10-08:/between-clients.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a freelance data scientist, I use time between client engagements to up-skill and pursue professional interests that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t otherwise be able&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of the summer I had time between engagements to work on some side projects and grapple with some new (to me) libraries and&amp;nbsp;technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;During August and September 2019,&amp;nbsp;I:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practiced creating websites using the &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;web-framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigated and demo&amp;#8217;ed &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/"&gt;django-plotly-dash&lt;/a&gt; - a library that allows exposing &lt;a href="https://dash.plot.ly"&gt;Plotly Dash&lt;/a&gt; apps to django&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built a personal finance dashboard using &lt;a href="https://dash.plot.ly"&gt;Plotly Dash&lt;/a&gt; and began turning it into a web app using &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/"&gt;django-plotly-dash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewed for a role at &lt;a href="https://coinmetrics.io"&gt;CoinMetrics.io&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu/btc-fork-analysis.html"&gt;this investigation&lt;/a&gt; as a technical&amp;nbsp;exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a company &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://atlasdata.nl"&gt;Atlas Consulting Internatonal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; to facilitate life as a freelance data scientist and&amp;nbsp;consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent a lot of time working at the cafe in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IKEA&lt;/span&gt; because my co-working space wouldn&amp;#8217;t let me stay late or work on public&amp;nbsp;holidays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduced myself to this &lt;a href="http://haarlemoffice.nl"&gt;new coworking space&lt;/a&gt; and suggested we could work together to create the best tech-focussed startup hub and coworking space in the&amp;nbsp;Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought our first car. It required a lot more time and research than I&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created &lt;a href="http://www.texnidata.com"&gt;Texni Data Consultancy&lt;/a&gt; with Dan Caputo to provide data strategy consultancy&amp;nbsp;services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built the website for &lt;a href="http://www.texnidata.com"&gt;Texni Data&lt;/a&gt; using django and deployed it to Heroku with a custom domain&amp;nbsp;name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployed a django app to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com"&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/"&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu"&gt;business website&lt;/a&gt; to represent my work as a freelance data scientist and made my &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; a subdomain of this&amp;nbsp;site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moved my blog off of github pages and onto &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com"&gt;firebase&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks Github for several years of simple trouble free&amp;nbsp;hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimented with using storage buckets on Google Cloud Platform to host static sites and serve them over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;. My conclusion is that serving static sites using storage buckets is great - it&amp;#8217;s simple, quick and cheap (free). But adding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; proved too difficult. I spent too many hours trying to create a loadbalancer that would work for both the root domain &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu"&gt;johnmathews.eu&lt;/a&gt; and also a subdomain &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu"&gt;blog.johnmathews.eu&lt;/a&gt;. In the end I found out about firebase. Firebase is also quick and cheap (free) and simple enough to pick-up&amp;nbsp;quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a photo book using &lt;a href="https://www.photobox.co.uk"&gt;PhotoBox&lt;/a&gt; that turned out great. It covers the last 3.5 years and is mostly full of snapshots of our kids and selfies with&amp;nbsp;Ritsya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chose a primary school for my daughter to go to next&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skylights, glass walls and bright colors create a light and airy atmosphere, and the space seems popular with designers and founders working in creative industries. It&amp;#8217;s an energetic space with a creative feel to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

This truth is in the process of going from self evident, to assumed, to&amp;nbsp;denied.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A useful model I&amp;#8217;ve come across states that it takes three generations for a society to deny something previously considered true. The first generation studies or experiences something which leads to a particular value or belief. The second generation inherits the belief and assumes it to be true, but doesn&amp;#8217;t arrive at the belief through their own critical thought. The third generation then questions the assumption, realises that most holders of the belief do not have a good basis for their belief, and disregards&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belief that people have a responsibility to look after each other and treat each other with a minimum level of respect seems to be following this&amp;nbsp;route.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That humans inherently deserve a degree of respect and dignity simply because they are human is self-evident. In times of comfort and excess it could be ignored, but in times of calamity and in the aftermath of disasters it becomes undeniable and obvious. This is partly because disasters reveal our instinct for justice and our frailty in the face of&amp;nbsp;misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is experienced through the lens of the mind, and its perception is mostly governed by fundamental circumstances or desires. The trappings of a prosperous society allows this reality to be covered by a veneer of soft arguments, or rejected in favor of a viewpoint that says we have superseded these supposedly basic&amp;nbsp;origins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good leaders should know better. They should study history and be self-aware. In the past they have forgotten this reality and have been forced to relearn it at great cost. Are we about to forget, again, and let our children live with those&amp;nbsp;consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfathers generation saw the damage that sectarian systems bring, and were forced to answer questions around how much respect people deserve only because they are people. As the consequences of different views and systems became evident, my fathers generation assumed the answers to be self-evident, because the consequences of the previous &amp;#8220;forgetting&amp;#8221; were still&amp;nbsp;clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is clearly articulating this now? This&amp;nbsp;year? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we discuss taxation, social mobility, migration, military intervention, why do we not start with the assumed self-evident truth that people are inherently valuable and important? Humans are more than metrics, and cannot be entirely evaluated using only quantitative&amp;nbsp;methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horton, the title character in &amp;#8220;Horton Hears a Who&amp;#8221; by Dr. Zeus, understood this. He went to great lengths to protect the tiny and weak people in who-ville. We teach this truth to our children, but do not demonstrate it as adults. Jesus also understood it. He said that we should love our neighbours, and explained that our neighbours are people we come across who need our&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if forgetting that humans are inherently worthy of respect is a prerequisite for&amp;nbsp;declining;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;standards of&amp;nbsp;governance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;social&amp;nbsp;mobility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;peace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;economic&amp;nbsp;growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes me think it is a self defeating deception. When we choose to disregard a group of humans because it is inconvenient to help them, we are elevating our needs above theirs. This seems to create chains of events where everybody&amp;nbsp;suffers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Family"></category><category term="Politics"></category><category term="Equality"></category></entry><entry><title>Live near theÂ ocean</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/ocean.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-23T18:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-11-23T18:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2017-11-23:/ocean.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being near water is&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;

I ran around Dublin visiting as many as&amp;nbsp;possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking to rent a hotdesk, which means I don&amp;#8217;t have any storage space at the office and I don&amp;#8217;t have a particular&amp;nbsp;desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are my impressions of eight businesses offering either hot desks or dedicated desks, ranked in order of preference. It&amp;#8217;s subjective. The going rate in Dublin seems to be â¬200 â â¬300 per month for a hot desk. Hours range from 9am - 7pm Monday - Friday, to&amp;nbsp;24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First place: &lt;a href="http://dogpatchlabs.com/"&gt;Dogpatch&amp;nbsp;Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogpatch offer a coworking space and access to a community of tech startups. They run regular networking and mentoring events and occupy 3 floors of a warehouse next to an old dock. The offices have a range of interiors styles. The middle level is fairly standard but pleasant open plan offices, the top floor is a flexible working space with event areas. The lower level is a series of vaults that each contain meeting rooms of various sizes. There&amp;#8217;s a lot going on and there&amp;#8217;s a good buzz in the&amp;nbsp;air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of interior spaces is a big plus for me and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to being able to switch up my working environment through the day. There&amp;#8217;s a couple of kitchen areas, and a table football and table-tennis table on the top level. Access is 6am - midnight, and a hot desk is â¬200 per month. A dedicated desk is&amp;nbsp;â¬400. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogpatch occupy less than a quarter of the warehouse building, the remainder of the space is used as a shopping mall and a museum. In my opinion Dogpatch is by far the best value and if you&amp;#8217;re working in tech it&amp;#8217;ll probably be your go-to&amp;nbsp;solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second place: &lt;a href="http://studio9.ie/?page_id=223"&gt;Studio9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys are great. The space is a lot smaller that Dogpatch, comprising only ~12 desks. It&amp;#8217;s a basement, but don&amp;#8217;t let that put you off â its open plan and has large windows at either end. The space is well designed and uses a lot of light colours and textures, including wood on the walls and floors. There are also plenty of pot plants. These combine to give a bright and airy atmosphere that feels very natural and&amp;nbsp;bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alcoves down one side of the main room which serve as meeting rooms, and a garden and basic kitchen at the back. The owners want the space to foster a community, and I expect that this is achieved. There are no dedicated offices and no teams using multiple desks, everyone is an independent&amp;nbsp;worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desks are large, and each has its own little wall to provide some privacy. â¬200 per month ongoing, or â¬250 for just one month. They offer a trial day for&amp;nbsp;free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Third place: &lt;a href="http://www.officesuites.ie/locations/20-harcourt-street/"&gt;OfficeSuites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building looks well run and appears clean and fresh with adequate resources. The building is an old Georgian tenement with high ceilings, cornicing and lots of natural light. The furnishings and decor lean towards corporate rather than something more interesting, but this works well to add a professional feel to the homely architecture. Access is&amp;nbsp;24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s only two rooms for hotdesking, and most of the building is given to private offices. There&amp;#8217;s a garden with bike storage, meeting rooms and a quiet room for calls. Lockers are extra. They also offer a free day as a&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬249 p/m for desk access 9am-7pm Monday -&amp;nbsp;Friday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fourth place: &lt;a href="https://www.element78.co/"&gt;Element78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendly and well resourced, but very corporate. The architecture is corporate glass and steel. They&amp;#8217;re situated on the ground floor in a posh business district with large financials for neighbours. It&amp;#8217;s too corporate for me, but if you wanted an impressive place to meet clients and a nice address, this could be it. There were about 15 hot-desks for rent, plus plenty of dedicated desks. Clients seemed to include mostly young tech companies and tech&amp;nbsp;freelancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hoping to find somewhere with more of a community, more inspiring architecture, and more character. I was offered a free day as a&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬200 for the first month then â¬350&amp;nbsp;p/m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fifth place: &lt;a href="https://glandore.co/flexible-workspace.aspx#Hot-Desk"&gt;Glandore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glandore offer a relatively luxurious package with a corporate feel. They have a few buildings in Dublin and only the flagship has hotdesking space. There&amp;#8217;s a super looking restaurant and a large club room to relax in, but these are features that I don&amp;#8217;t need, and the rates aren&amp;#8217;t competitive if all you need is a desk and somewhere to take calls. It&amp;#8217;s set up for teams and for impressing clients, and independent tech workers are probably better off&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬295&amp;nbsp;p/m &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sixth place: &lt;a href="https://www.regus.ie/office-space/ireland/dublin/dublin-4-ballsbridge"&gt;Regus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regus offer a polished on boarding experience and the friendly staff were quick to respond and generally helpful, but the office space was bland, grey and generic. The rooms I visited didn&amp;#8217;t have external windows and it reminded me of the rooms banks often put auditors in. If grey walls and tube lights are your thing then this is for you.  24/7 access, and meeting rooms equipped with&amp;nbsp;A/V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬299.70&amp;nbsp;p/m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seventh place: &lt;a href="http://www.cocreate.ie/"&gt;CoCreate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited the southern branch and thought the building was a bit shabby and needed a new layer of paint. I recognised the desks as some of the cheapest available from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IKEA&lt;/span&gt;. The rooms were small and needed cleaning, and there was weird art on the&amp;nbsp;wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of paying â¬200 a month to sit at a small wobbly desk put me off. The place was also almost deserted. Maybe their other branch is better, but this is not for&amp;nbsp;me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬220&amp;nbsp;p/m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Last place: &lt;a href="http://tcubedublin.com/tcube/index.html"&gt;tCube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last and least, tCube seems to be putting in zero effort. When I visited I saw two rooms that needed painting, disorganised furniture and abandoned bits of computers lying around. The kitchen isn&amp;#8217;t high spec and the meeting room isn&amp;#8217;t big enough. I was also given a speech about how great the wifi was - a prerequisite that was taken for granted everywhere else. At â¬300 p/m for a dedicated desk its easy to find better value&amp;nbsp;elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Career"></category><category term="Freelance"></category><category term="Coworking"></category><category term="Dublin"></category><category term="Element78"></category><category term="Regus"></category><category term="OfficeSuites"></category><category term="CoCreate"></category><category term="Studio9"></category><category term="Glandore"></category><category term="tCube"></category></entry><entry><title>CorporateÂ London</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/corporate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-10T21:37:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-07-10T21:37:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2017-07-10:/corporate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reflections on 3 years living and working in&amp;nbsp;London&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2014 -&amp;nbsp;2017&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made arrangements to leave London, it seems like a reasonable time to reflect on my time&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is a tough city to live in â it&amp;#8217;s big enough that a sub 1-hour commute is considered good, and it&amp;#8217;s super expensive. My stay in London has been defined by my quest to complete my graduate scheme and qualify as an&amp;nbsp;accountant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first arrived I had no idea what London or working in a corporate would be like. I was coming from academia, and my motivation for moving to finance could be summed up in two&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand more about the 2008 financial&amp;nbsp;crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get paid more for using mostly the same skills (math) as in&amp;nbsp;engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donât think thereâs anything wrong with these motivations, but I should have been making a long term career plan&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my job I was surprised at the 6 weeks of induction and hot-desking. Life as an auditor felt nomadic, as everyone would spend large amounts of time at client&amp;#8217;s offices, and no-one has their own desk in our office. The only thing you really own is your knowledge and your network of&amp;nbsp;relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I arrived with a high opinion of my employer and the view that I would be staying for several years. Having escaped the financial insecurity of short-term research grants, Iâd moved back to my home country to contribute to the system that educated me. I was happy to have a regular job with a decent, predictable&amp;nbsp;salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase that kept coming to mind back then was âaccountant factoryâ. Our training materials were scripted and everything was a standardised process. We were being processed. Graduates in, corporate accountants&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is huge and so are the efficiencies and barriers to competition that come with this. When I arrived I was impressed there were free biscuits, and it felt presumptuous to put a meeting in someones diary. Now I ignore any communications addressed to a mailing&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accountant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toughest experiences were related to the accountancy qualification. NaÃ¯vely I had believed that the qualification wouldnât be a big deal and I didnât give any thought to it when I applied â I just wanted to find out how banks worked. If there were some exams to be done then it would be fine, Iâd already achieved a PhD and I would handle&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be a mistake. A huge mistake. The alarm bells should have rung louder when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so that they could get the qualification (and were already intending to leave asap afterwards). Doing the pre-course work before college wasn&amp;#8217;t trivial. College - I was being sent to a classroom again. We were being taken out of the office, away from clients, and put in a classroom to prepare for these&amp;nbsp;examsâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant, without considering the effort and time involved to qualify was dumb. Itâs an oversight I find hard to&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disappointment and sadness at having to study again was profound. The teaching and assessment style was several steps behind what Iâd become used to. Compared to the depth, autonomy and research-focus of a doctorate, writing cookie-cutter essays in time-pressured exams felt stupid. The exams were hard and I failed several of them, probably because of my low morale whilst revising. Retaking them required more weekends and annual leave being spent away from my family, camped-out in libraries and&amp;nbsp;offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This required much patience and generosity from Ritsya, who having not seen me for long periods during my doctorate expected us to have a more normal lifestyle when we came to London. I found it miserable to pause my social life and other interests whilst studying, and then I would try to rush back to them when I had the time, knowing that soon Iâd have to pause them&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hadnât already studied in Vienna, this process of working and studying in London would have been exciting and felt valuable or special. Iâd passed enough exams though to know that theyâre never as important as theyâre made out to be, and whatever it was that was missing from my life wasnât going to be found in another&amp;nbsp;qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside though, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt; is the most practical qualification Iâve gained and has taught me many useful aspects of business and finance. Iâm glad to finally see business not as some mysterious system but something attainable and&amp;nbsp;understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in London has also required a lot of time on trains â my door to desk commute is about an hour each way, and Iâve never lived somewhere in London that hasnât felt transient. Weâve needed to live near a station and didnât want to commute more than an hour and thatâs put us in neighbourhoods with other young professionals who also donât have long term plans (or financial ability) to stay in the city. Weâre all looking to move on and move up as fast as possible.  I want to leave London partly because there are so many people with the same attitudes and priorities as my&amp;nbsp;ownâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate&amp;nbsp;Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the office I spent the first few months figuring out how people were organised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. I think it took me about a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years to feel like I could do all aspects of my job with certainty. There is a difference between how things are spoken about, and how things actually&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience has been that performance is all that matters and behaviour is defined by self-interest. I donât think this is different from previous environments I&amp;#8217;ve worked in â academia isn&amp;#8217;t any different&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the construction industry certainly isnât. I wonder if the only way people can endure it is if theyâve not experienced anything else, or think it normal, or necessary. I find myself wishing we could be kinder to each other, and that we could create structures that incentivise mutual&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate finance usually appears clean and well presented. Its people appear dependable and capable. The culture is sanitised and there&amp;#8217;s a lot of pressure to conform - you can see it in the clothes and accessories we wear and the jokes we tell each other in the&amp;nbsp;canteen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to see my office as a glass and steel cathedral. I read about the Middle East, and migrants arriving in Europe, and tower blocks burning, and felt really&amp;nbsp;disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we donât ask each other how we can help. Maybe we are too busy, or feel powerless to help. Apparently we do not know how to help, despite our wealth, talents, education and&amp;nbsp;connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember watching a man leave the office one day and thought that if he gave his whole career and left his firm after decades of service, there would be nothing left to identify him after a few weeks. The work will always get done. Market forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. The City rolls&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publications trump almost all other metrics, and the incentives to publish quantity over quality are such that risky or slow research is inexcusable. The metrics used to standardise success and allocate resources can be subverted just as well in academia as in any other industry. What management measures, the team prioritises.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was 15, one of my ambitions has been to be an entrepreneur. I used to joke with my dad about buying him a nice boat one&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life so far has been predominantly about education, and that stage is over now. Iâm walking away from what I&amp;#8217;ve come to see as a lifestyle and career that has too many contradictions, it doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to live like this. Ultimately I want to develop multiple sources of passive income. I want to&amp;nbsp;create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer&amp;nbsp;2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been intense, with some weeks leaving me feeling ambitious and energetic, and others feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I need to get better at defining a goal, taking the quickest path there, and ignoring interesting&amp;nbsp;distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritsya is brave enough and imaginative enough to force me to think big and consider how to live a better life. My biggest fear is that I screw it up, shooting myself in the foot and Ritsya and my daughter also. We were headed safely to an unremarkable existence and it would be terrible to swap that for something worse. That won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I make better decisions and produce my best work under pressure, I thrive when I&amp;#8217;m perceived as an underdog. I need to accept this without using it as a reason to be foolish. Whilst I donât have a clear plan, or direction, or goal, (I have many of them) Iâve got skills and I want to see what I can make. Iâll never do my best work, using my most productive combination of skills and experiences, if Iâm a cog in someone else&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs safer being an employee than self-employed. I guess the price of removing self-employment risks is the difference between the value you generate for your employer and what youâre paid. I think those risks are overpriced, and most people are more capable than they realise. Sometimes you have to walk into a situation to find out how to make the most of it. And sometimes you have to leave a place in order to gain&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Autumn&amp;nbsp;2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year my boss gave me some advice that was supposed to be encouraging. Iâd requested to reduce my involvement with some stuff that was unrelated to my job so that I could contribute more to my team and still maintain some semblance of a work/life&amp;nbsp;balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss was pretty clear that reducing my involvement in the extra stuff would not be possible. During our conversation he advised me not to worry about how much I contributed to the team because âthe work will get done anywayâ. This was meant to be encouraging, but instead removed any conviction that the work I did was&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Family"></category><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Flee</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/flee.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T08:42:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T08:42:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2017-07-04:/flee.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Summer children &lt;/br&gt;

One of the best sessions was with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;#8220;Understand Investment&amp;#8221;. These are my&amp;nbsp;notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are seeking to identify high-potential startups, and then support and fund&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are looking for something that is innovative and&amp;nbsp;unproven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A startup is not a company but an organisation searching for a business&amp;nbsp;model,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whilst executing and discovering a scalable way to&amp;nbsp;grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups need money for ambitious but credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical stake for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; could be roughly&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s want an exit price of at least 100m, otherwise their business models don&amp;#8217;t work&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10m can seem a lot for a founder with a 30% stake, but it&amp;#8217;s not enough to attract VCs, so aim&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&amp;nbsp;pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify specific people with real&amp;nbsp;needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size of&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your clear competitive advantage - why can no-one else do&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a large and attractive&amp;nbsp;marketâ¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a smart, skilled and cohesive&amp;nbsp;team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a strong ability to deliver quickly and to learn&amp;nbsp;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is ready to go big whatever it&amp;nbsp;takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a unique vision and&amp;nbsp;project-fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuable and differentiated&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient go-to-market and growth&amp;nbsp;channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable monetisation&amp;nbsp;strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability and&amp;nbsp;defensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show traction and that you&amp;#8217;ve cracked the important&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show ambitous and credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a capital-efficient growth&amp;nbsp;model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a clear strategy to scale and&amp;nbsp;win&lt;/li&gt;

Learn to leverage your time, you can never get it back. Being a successful founder is not impossible, it is always&amp;nbsp;exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whilst at the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; I went to a session called &amp;#8220;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve written generally about the summit &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu/lis17.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oussama spoke with passion and humour. It&amp;#8217;s clear that he cares about encouraging would-be founders and confronting some of the cultural hurdles that exist in Europe. These are my notes from the&amp;nbsp;session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are serious about building something that matters then you have a great and exciting future&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can never predict who will be successful and who will fail. There are a lot of dumb successful people and clever founders can&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really important to learn how to leverage your time effectively. You can lose anything else and get it back but you can never recover the time you&amp;#8217;ve already&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to succeed is to try&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to do something that&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe you need to be more ambitious than average (measured against other countries) because the environment makes it harder to be an entrepreneur. (Attitudes to risk, comfort, security, expectations of failure.. are all unhelpful for&amp;nbsp;founders.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not impossible, just harder. So be more&amp;nbsp;ambitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is replaceable, no-one is&amp;nbsp;unique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can always lose money and replace it. There is so much money in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at Crunchbase and see the failure rate for companies that raised $1m - $10m, it is the same rate for those that raised&amp;nbsp;$10m+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you lose money on a project you will learn things from that experience and you can leverage that&amp;nbsp;learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;â¦ But you will never get back the time you&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zombies are companies that make enough money to survive but not enough to provide joy to the people in the company - aim high&amp;nbsp;andâ¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a company is a big deal, like starting a marriage. Think hard about what you will be doing, what problem you are trying to solve, who you will be working&amp;nbsp;with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe there is not enough money to go around and this makes pitching hard. Silicon Valley doesn&amp;#8217;t have this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average a startup in Europe will raise less than a startup in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe is irrationally concerned about risk. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is less concerned with risk and this is very&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So be pragmatic about&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate in London where the laws are good, even if you don&amp;#8217;t want to operate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. It has a better designed system of corporate law. Estonia is also&amp;nbsp;good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best European city for&amp;nbsp;founders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London, Paris,&amp;nbsp;Berlin..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a best city because none are&amp;nbsp;holistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London has the&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paris has engineering and product development (and no-one outside Paris knows the products&amp;nbsp;exist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin has automation and execution, execution and&amp;nbsp;scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¦You need to draw on all 3 of these cities, which when taken together can surpass Silicon&amp;nbsp;Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anecdotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of Slack lives in Vancouver with his wife and kids. He spends 1 day each week in California and everyone thinks Slack is Californian due to good marketing. Forget national pride, be pragmatic. Leverage the&amp;nbsp;internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of Airbnb would fly from New York to California for 1 day each week. They were originally in California where AirBnB started, but decided that if they could make it work in New York then AirBnB would be a success, so they moved to New York and flew back for meetings , etc. If you ask Europeans to come to a meeting in London (which is not as far as California is from New York) people start complaining and deciding they can&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;bothered. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Entrepreneurship"></category><category term="LIS"></category><category term="Startup"></category><category term="FinTech"></category><category term="Europe"></category></entry><entry><title>The Lisbon InvestmentÂ Summit</title><link href="https://johnmathews.eu/lis17.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2017-06-09:/lis17.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Lisbon investment Summit was full of Investors as well as Founders. The sessions were good enough but the real value was in the&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; on June 6 and 7 as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; InsurTech startup team with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jd_sullivan?lang=en-gb"&gt;John Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first startup conference I&amp;#8217;d been to and I arrived hoping to have some useful conversations and understand more about the Fintech and startup spaces in Europe. As usual I wanted to focus on tech, finance and&amp;nbsp;blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who was&amp;nbsp;there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as some outstanding sessions there was a high ratio of investors to startups. This made talking to VCs, bankers and M&amp;amp;A lawyers really easy. I was happy to meet a London-based and Fintech-focussed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; when I sat down to have lunch, and thanks to interrupting a session to ask blockchain related questions on Day 1, a banker struck up a conversation with me over breakfast the next day. I met a lot of people across many relevant roles, and once I&amp;#8217;ve worked through my notes and my new collection of business cards I hope to have some great follow-up&amp;nbsp;meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useful&amp;nbsp;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most useful sessions for me&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu/ambitious.html"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thefamily.co"&gt;TheFamily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu/investment.html"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Understanding Investment&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.partechventures.com"&gt;Partech&amp;nbsp;Ventures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Building successful businesses on blockchain technologies&amp;#8221; a panel discussion moderated by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kloaec?lang=en"&gt;Kevin Loaec&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="http://chainsmiths.com/"&gt;Chainsmiths&lt;/a&gt; blockchain consultancy, and including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mir_btc"&gt;Mir Serena Liponi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.blockchainlab.it/"&gt;Blockchain&amp;nbsp;Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain session was valuable because it&amp;#8217;s unusual to meet people who have been working in the blockchain space for several years. I&amp;#8217;m always wary of being distracted by the hype and noise around developments in the blockchain space so I appreciated hearing some informed and level-headed&amp;nbsp;opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political&amp;nbsp;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening session included a speech from the Mayor of Lisbon and the next day opened with a speech from the Secretary of Industry. Both speeches conveyed an open and progressive attitude to international cooperation aimed at promoting and supporting founders and startups in Portugal. The warm words were supported by practical measures including tax incentives and a state-backed scheme to match amounts contributed by private investors. It was really refreshing to hear a politician extol the virtues of multinational cooperation and bringing different cultures into Portugal. I wish Britain could do this&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Brexit, which inevitably arose due to London&amp;#8217;s present role as a centre of finance and innovation, it seems Europe is still expecting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; to come to its senses, and cannot understand why it&amp;#8217;s destroying its goodwill and reputation so&amp;nbsp;thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two days in Lisbon were full of useful and energetic conversations and it was a great experience pitching &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; multiple times and talking about what we&amp;#8217;re trying to do and how blockchains are a part of that. The opportunities to meet founders and investors are invaluable for making informed decisions. Lisbon is a beautiful city which I found easy to get around and always felt safe in. It&amp;#8217;s also refreshingly &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu/london.html"&gt;affordable!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone knows that this is mostly due to the price of property, which we all enjoy talking&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve lived here for 3 years now, and when my wife and I were both working we lived comfortably. Two incomes under one roof is just fine. Not as fine as in many other cities, but reasonable. Just over a year ago my first child was born, and now that my wife&amp;#8217;s maternity pay has ended we are a single income household. This is not&amp;nbsp;fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I earn almost Â£50k/year, and any salary increase will be taxed at 40%, I cannot cover essential day-to-day costs. I&amp;#8217;m in the 40% tax bracket, and my basic monthly outgoings exceed my monthly take home pay by Â£400. If my employer wanted to pay me enough to cover essential costs, it would cost them approximately double the shortfall due to tax. None of this makes&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salaries and living expenses have become really&amp;nbsp;disconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people the most obvious way to increase wealth is to buy property. Mortgage repayments are cheaper than rent, and the value of the property increases over time. Double win. But there is a big hurdle to overcome before this is possible - saving money for a deposit on a house is often impossible without external help (i.e. the &amp;#8220;Bank of Mum and Dad&amp;#8221;), because so much of the money earnt must be spent on rent&amp;nbsp;first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a trap. Repayments on a mortgage are cheaper than paying rent, but you cannot save enough for a deposit&amp;nbsp;because;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so much of your salary goes to paying rent&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the average cost of a &lt;em&gt;flat&lt;/em&gt; in London is 500k&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which means a 5% deposit is Â£25k â which is a higher deposit than you would need anywhere else in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, despite being the place you are least able to accumulate&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if my partner went back to work and we put our baby in childcare? Childcare is not cheap, and working would need to bring in more than the cost of childcare. This requires a higher than average salary from a graduate job, (which is the life stage when people might reasonably start having children), so unless both parents are unusually high earners that option isnt viable&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in London is only financially possible if you are either single or household income is more than&amp;nbsp;Â£60k/year.&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote it when I began to study for my last set of exams and my mind filled with things I&amp;#8217;d rather be doing instead. Some of these interests are just me reacting to having no spare time for a few months, but others are decent goals and projects. Temporarily losing my spare time made me value it&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free-time" src="/images/spare_time.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this postÂ so that I could compare what I thought was important when I was busy toÂ when I wasn&amp;#8217;t. Writing the list allowed me to move on without forgetting. Here&amp;#8217;s a break down of each&amp;nbsp;item:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Run 10k in 50 minutes&amp;#8221; - This is easier than I imagined. When I wrote the list I could barely run 2k without stopping, but intended to go for a weekly run whilst studying. I&amp;#8217;ve struggled to stay energetic and healthy during previous exam phases, so now I have a rule that I mustÂ do some mild exercise even if I think I can&amp;#8217;t spare the time. I find running really lowers my stress levels, and increasingÂ my heart rate and working up a sweat lets me sleep better
    and concentrate for longer. After a few weeks of minimal running, I could run 5k easily. If I kept at it, 10k in 50 mins would be easy.Â But point&amp;nbsp;2&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Be Insanity strong&amp;#8221; - As in, do the Insanity workout programme. Again. I thought about it and decided to do P90x instead. Week 1 is going&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Read the bible habitually&amp;#8221; - When I was 17 I found out about Jesus and became a Christian. In the months and years after that I&amp;#8217;d regularly read my bible almost every day and pray a lot. I wanted to understand, so I set a goal of 5 chapters each&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read through the new testament repeatedlyÂ and read most of the old testament during this time. I knew the scriptures well enough that a lot of sermons became boring and obvious - I&amp;#8217;d already studiedÂ the bible passage being used. During this time I remember being aware that the way I thought was different to how it would have been otherwise. My perspectives were long-term and less me focused. I thought about what I was reading instead ofÂ the days&amp;#8217; headlines or social chatter. I remember enjoying the benefits and thinking that I should keep this habit. The reasons why I think Christianity is so wonderfulÂ are well summarised in &lt;a href="http://messages.destinyedinburgh.com/sermon/the-gospel-we-preach-a-message-for-leaders"&gt;this sermon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s now 10 years later, and whilst my convictions are strong, my knowledge of the bible is sadly pretty fuzzy. My thinking is clouded by the perspectives contained in the media I consume and the conversations I&amp;#8217;m part of. I strongly suspect I would be acting and
thinking differently if I read my bible more, but I don&amp;#8217;t know what those differences would be. Trouble is, it&amp;#8217;s often not obvious what the immediate benefits of readingÂ the bible are, you have to work for it a bit. Praying for helpÂ is effective.Â The books in the bible were written to last through the ages and across all cultures, so it&amp;#8217;s not surprising that they&amp;#8217;re not as easy to read as something written for an English speaker in a hurry. I should stop being in a hurry, and stop prioritising only quantifiable&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Think more&amp;#8221; - On a similar note to 3, but less supernatural. If I spent less time consuming content and a little more looking around me or walking, I reckon I&amp;#8217;d be more self-aware and make better decisions. This would probably lead to a happier, more satisfying&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Pray more&amp;#8221; - I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but the creator of the universe wants me to talk andÂ share my life with him. He cares about me. This makes no sense to me, at all. If I was God, I would not go out of my way to consider the views and concerns of a very flawed human. But
    when I pray, my prayers are very often answered. I should ask him about&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Amazon seller?&amp;#8221; - Amazon have this &amp;#8220;Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#8221; service,
    which means you don&amp;#8217;t even need to hold the stock you want to sell.
    If I choose the right products, import them cheaply from China and
    reselling Â them on Amazon at a profit, I end up quids in for minimal
    effort and manageable risk. Sounds&amp;nbsp;intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Blog about interesting data&amp;#8221; - Here I am, blogging. I shouldÂ stick
    to the main topicÂ and get technical. I was inspired by this
    &lt;a href="http://www.curiousgnu.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; in&amp;nbsp;particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Finish Coursera&amp;#8221; - The data science specialization is great! It&amp;#8217;s in R, and I want to focus on Python, but I&amp;#8217;d still like to do it. I need to consider the opportunity cost of the time committed,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Read for fun, history, fiction&amp;#8221; - When I started my job, in April 2014, I was half way through &lt;a href="https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;preview=newtab&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4"&gt;Savage Continent&lt;/a&gt;, which is an eye-opening and eye-watering history of Europe in the years after World War 2. I see Europe through different eyes because of it. However I only got half way though, and since April &amp;#8216;14 I never felt I had the free time or energy to pick it back up. This should change. When I was a researcher, and when I was a student, I had so much more opportunity to develop my own pursuits. Since entering the corporate world, I find myself fighting a war of attrition to exert my personality onto my lifestyle. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; Read for fiction&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m unconvinced. What do you have at the end of it? What can you do with it? Maybe I&amp;#8217;ve just been reading the wrong authors, but I&amp;#8217;m going to leave this for now. Sure, you could gainÂ an appreciation of a different time or place, but that appreciation comes via the fictional characters and events, its secondary. What about abstract constructs, perspectives, morals&amp;#8230; things that history books are ill-suited for? Great fiction would be essential for exploring these. But for now, I&amp;#8217;ll prioritise point 3.&lt;/br&gt;  &lt;/br&gt; &lt;iframe style="max-width: 100%; float:middle" src="https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/card?asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;preview=inline&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do a photography project&amp;#8221; - This I would love to do, but probably won&amp;#8217;t. It would be a luxury, and the opportunity cost would be too great right now. I&amp;#8217;d like to shoot a series of black and white portraits, and turn them into large prints. I think good portrait photography is uniquely impactful and moving, choosing B&amp;amp;W removes distractions and leaves a subjects humanity more&amp;nbsp;exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Have a list of business/product ideas&amp;#8221; - There&amp;#8217;s no excuse for this
    one, anyone can have several good ideas. It&amp;#8217;s turning them into
    reality that takes skill. Need to have the ideas first,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do a law &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOOC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - i.e Study particular areas of law, in my own time
    and at my own pace. I studied a tiny bit of law during the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt;, and
    realised employment law or contract law could be really useful.
    (Same for the tax system - another surprise).Â We only had a brief
    introduction though, so if I could find the time I&amp;#8217;d like to know&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do an InfoSec or Network SecurityÂ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOOC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - Its super interesting,
    but not likely to be a good use of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Learn to fight - Krav Maga / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - Ever since watching The Bourne
    Identity I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to learn Krav Maga, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LybrzdG96_8"&gt;Georges
    St-Pierre&lt;/a&gt; made me want to train
    forÂ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMA&lt;/span&gt;. For now though, I&amp;#8217;ll do P90x. I can reconsider in 90&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;

Â &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Get out of London&amp;#8221; - My contract ends in April 2017, next summer
    will be a crossroads. I hate the commute, I hate being constantly
    rushed. Living in other cities has been a lot more&amp;nbsp;pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

pre-breakfastÂ hours for distraction-free productivity. And for years I
have spectacularly failed at this. I love the quiet, distraction-free
hours at the end of the day too, as well as waking up slowly.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many famous leaders and politicians are known to start their days early,
and I would like to be able to do this too. After years of trying and
failing, I have had a&amp;nbsp;break-through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of waking up early is&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become a&amp;nbsp;parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first couple of months with a&amp;nbsp;new-born:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be well-practiced at quickly waking up at previously
    unthinkable&amp;nbsp;times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be used to operating on less sleep than you ever thought&amp;nbsp;possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your beautiful child will become a reliable alarm clock, waking you
    up at the crack of dawn with cute smiles and increasingly insistent
    demands that you get up, play and make&amp;nbsp;breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the freedom to begin sleeping and working when you want, I still believe this is a great option. I bashed out a PhD in 3.5 years during which I usually woke up late and began to work around lunch time! - Glorious autonomy!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
