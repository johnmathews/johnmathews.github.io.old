        <p>This post is based on the excellent seminar by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja &#8220;Scaling Bitcoin to Billions of Transactions Per Day&#8221; which was given at the San Francisco bitcoin developers conference in early 2015. You can see the seminar <a href="https://youtu.be/8zVzw912wPo">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Problem</h2>
<p>Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t scale well enough to facilitate the rate of transactions necessary for it to become a medium of exchange in everyday life. This is&nbsp;because</p>
<ol>
<li>Transactions aren&#8217;t instant - the average block time is 10&nbsp;minutes</li>
<li>Transaction fees are variable and too high (particularly when blocks are almost full) to enable low value transactions&nbsp;(micro-payments)</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin has a <span class="caps">1MB</span> block size limit. This allows about 2750 transactions per block <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-block">(link)</a> or 4.6 transactions per second. This isn&#8217;t fast enough for a global payment&nbsp;system.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>Bigger&nbsp;blocks</h3>
<p>In 2017 there was a lot of contentious debate about how to solve Bitcoins scaling problems. One of the most frequently suggested solutions is to increase the block size, so that more transactions can fit into each&nbsp;block.</p>
<p>If you had 7 billion people making 2 transactions per day, you would need <span class="caps">24GB</span> blocks, generating data at a rate of 3.<span class="caps">5TB</span>/day. This would make running a full bitcoin node impractical for many people which would result in centralisation, fewer miners and lower&nbsp;security. </p>
<p>(Note: you would expect corporations and large miners to support efforts to increase block sizes, because the associated infrastructure cost increases create a higher barrier for entry to newcomers. This would decrease the competition for new blocks and protect their revenue from miners&nbsp;fees.)</p>
<h3>More efficient&nbsp;databases</h3>
<p><span class="caps">SQL</span> is a much more efficient database model than a blockchain. Its scalable and fast, and is what is used today to power visa, master card, central banks. But it isn&#8217;t trustless. With a <span class="caps">SQL</span> database model you have a trusted 3rd party maintaining the database which everyone else needs to query to discover or verify a balance. This is equivalent to giving the 3rd party your money and trusting they do the right&nbsp;thing. </p>
<h3>Side&nbsp;chains</h3>
<p>A blockchain with other blockchains running parallel to it. Maybe like a a rope made of many different chords. Side chains are not primarily a scaling solution. If you want to send a payment to an address that is on a different side chain you would create 2 transactions. Not&nbsp;any-to-any.</p>
<h3>Payment&nbsp;channels</h3>
<p>Many payments between two predetermined parties. Useful when two parties pay each other multiple times, not necessarily good for paying many different accounts relatively few times each. Its not&nbsp;any-to-any.</p>
<hr>
<p>What we want is payments from <strong>anyone to&nbsp;anyone</strong></p>
<h3>Lightning&nbsp;Network</h3>
<ul>
<li>Payment channels between many parties in a multi-hop hub and spoke&nbsp;model</li>
<li>Minimally trusted intermediaries - they can&#8217;t take your coins, but they could conceivably delay&nbsp;setllement</li>
<li>Requires the malleability fix that occurred in&nbsp;2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous soft&nbsp;forks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay to script&nbsp;hash, </li>
<li>bip34 (coinbase&nbsp;transactions)</li>
</ol>
<h2>What are payment&nbsp;channels</h2>
<ul>
<li>Uses&nbsp;multisig</li>
<li>Allows two people to send transactions to each other quickly without hitting the blockchain&nbsp;everytime</li>
</ul>
<h3>A 2 party unidirectional payment&nbsp;channel</h3>
<p>Alice and Bob create a multisig address that they each&nbsp;control</p>
<p>Alice wants to send 1 <span class="caps">BTC</span> to the multisig&nbsp;address</p>
<p>Before she does this, she gets Bobs refund signature, this means that at worst, Alice loses her coin for 30&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Bob creates a 30 day nLock time refund signature, signs it, and sends it to&nbsp;Alice.</p>
<p>Alice can either sign it immediately and keep it, or wait to sign it herself (keeping it&nbsp;half-signed).</p>
<p>Once Alice has the refund signature she knows its safe to send her <span class="caps">BTC</span> to the multisig address she and Bob just&nbsp;created. </p>
