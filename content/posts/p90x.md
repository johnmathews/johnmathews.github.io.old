# P90x

I've just begun the P90x exercise programme and I'm loving it. 6 days in
and I feel clear-headed and less stressed. Most of my day is spent
sitting at a desk and I could feel my back beginning to cause problems.
I could probably stop this with a less intense fitness regime, but that
wouldn't have a clear or challenging goal.

I'm having [less trouble](http://johnmathews.eu/how-to-wake-up-early/) waking up early,
and I'm free of exams, so now is a great time to start. I've
completed the Insanity fitness programme a few times and I think it's
great [^1], but it's getting repetitive. I always liked Insanity for its
simplicity, particularly the lack of any equipment, but this time I
wanted to try something new.

...

I've completed the first week, and so far it's going great! After the
first two days I could hardly get out of bed I was so sore, and 90
minutes of yoga on day 4 initially seemed incredibly boring, but it's
day 6 and I'm feeling relaxed, energised and looking forward to week 2.

Diet and nutrition are a huge part of the programme. From doing the "Insanity" cardio workouts
I know that nutrition really affects results, so I'm doing my best to
eat clean and eat small regular meals. I've noticed my appetite
increasing.

The nutrition guide breaks the programme down into 3 stages, and if
I've understood it correctly I'm supposed to have very few Carbs at the
beginning. Too few and I'll feel tired all the time, though. I don't know
if I feel tired because of poor diet, or because I'm waking up at 6.30
and exercising for an hour...
