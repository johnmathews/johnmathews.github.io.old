#Article Lists

Here you will be able to view lists of articles collected around particular topics. 
An article might exist in more than one list.

Life and learning doesn't occur in an organised fashion, and ordering articles chronologically is not optimal for most of my readers.

This blog is created using Pelican (which is great, and a lot of fun) but Pelican's use of categories is too restrictive, so I'm creating lists to do what I wish I could do with categories. Maybe I should create a plugin for this. 

Lists:
- I'm new to Bitcoin/Crypto, start here
- Tokens
- Payments
- Research journal
- Photography
