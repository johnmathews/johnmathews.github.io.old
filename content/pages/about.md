# About

Iâ€™m an engineer (PhD, MEng) and a chartered accountant (ACA). I make a living by auditing banks. 

This is a blog of things I want to be better at and things I think are important. 

Information about my work investigating silos and granular flows at increased gravities can be found [here](...).

My [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1) is pretty thorough, and I'm beginning to get the hang of [github](www.github.com/johnmathews).
