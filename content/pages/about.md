#About
Thanks for visitng my blog. 

- I'm looking for opportunities to work on blockchain or fintech projects. I believe blockchain technologies offer great opportunities to make finance fairer and more efficient.
- I'd like to work outside the UK.
- I live in London.
- I work in financial services, auditing banks and analysing financial data. 
- My background is in engineering (PhD, MEng) and I started my career by qualifying as a chartered accountant (ACA). I see the world as an engineer, full of problems to be solved and things to be made. 

I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and my most recent projects are on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/johnmathews). My CV is available as a [word document]({attach}/documents/John_Mathews_CV.docx), as a [PDF]({attach}/documents/John_Mathews_CV.pdf) and on [Google](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2dxj_prWJiwT09OS1lBN0hwa3M/view?usp=sharing).

Information about my work researching silos and granular flows at increased gravities can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md).
