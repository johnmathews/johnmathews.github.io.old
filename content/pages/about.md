#<br> About
<br>
Iâ€™m an engineer (PhD, MEng) and a chartered accountant (ACA). I make a living by auditing banks.
<br><br>
My primary interests are digital currencies and social mobility. Algorithmic trading is another interest. 
<br><br>
I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and you can see some of my recent work on [github](http://www.github.com/johnmathews).

Information about my work investigating silos and granular flows at increased gravities can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md).
