#About
Thanks for visitng my blog. I'm an engineer working towards making finance more efficient, and the posts here are a haphazerd record of my curiosities and intrigues. I started my career in financial audits and have recently qualified as an accountant. Before that I achieved a doctorate in Engineering. I see a world full of opportunities to make things and problems to solve.

I live in London but before I came (back) to the UK I lived in Austria for 4 years, which was much more comfortable. I'm now actively seeking opportunities to move me and my family somewhere overseas, again.

I'm looking for opportunities to work on blockchain or fintech projects, because blockchains are incredible and finance needs to be fairer, quicker and easier to understand.

I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and my most recent projects are on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/johnmathews). My CV is available in [word]({attach}/documents/John_Mathews_CV.docx) and [PDF]({attach}/documents/John_Mathews_CV.pdf) formats, and is on [Google](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2dxj_prWJiwT09OS1lBN0hwa3M/view?usp=sharing).

Information about my work researching silos and granular flows at increased gravities can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md).
