#About
Thanks for visiting my blog. 

In 2017, I qualified as a chartered accountant and became a financial consultant. I began working with clients working on disintermediation problems and created my consultancy, [Anaheim Consulting B.V](https://anaheimconsulting.eu).

In 2014, I moved to London and began work as an external financial auditor for banking clients. I also began qualifying as a chartered accountant with the [ICAEW](https://careers.icaew.com/en/why-a-career-in-chartered-accountancy/why-become-an-icaew-chartered-accountant).

In 2010, I began my PhD researching granular materials at the [BOKU](https://www.baunat.boku.ac.at/igt/) in Vienna, Austria. 

In 2009 I graduated from Edinburgh University with a masters degree in Civil Engineering. The  [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) had arrived and I found a job at Starbucks. This made me curious about finance and I resolved to one day understand [how banks work](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n13/john-lanchester/after-the-fall). 

I'm on [AngelList](https://angel.co/john-mathews-3) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and my most recent projects are on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/johnmathews). My CV is available to [download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yuYuM-nOroFU2qWkHvPRoCSux_nchWkezYtH9CfF5P8/edit?usp=sharing).

Information about my current work might be [here](https://blockport.io/). Information about my work researching silos and granular flows can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md). If you'd like to know when I publish something new on this site, please [subscribe]({filename}../pages/subscribe.md) for updates. I don't send emails as often as I make new posts. 

I think that [this](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) is generally good advice, and [this](https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/) is a useful set of tools.
