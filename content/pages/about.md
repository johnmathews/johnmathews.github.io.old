#<br> About
<br>
Iâ€™m an engineer (PhD, MEng) and a chartered accountant (ACA). I make a living by auditing banks.
<br><br>
I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and I'm beginning to get the hang of [github](http://www.github.com/johnmathews).
<br><br>
Information about my work investigating silos and granular flows at increased gravities can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md).
