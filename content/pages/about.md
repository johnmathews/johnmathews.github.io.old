#About
Thanks for visiting my blog. I'm an engineer working towards making finance more efficient, and the posts here show the winding path I've taken. 

I'm looking for opportunities to work on blockchain or dapp projects in order to make finance fairer, quicker and simpler.

In 2009 I graduated from Edinburgh University with a masters in Civil Engineering. The  [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) had arrived and I found a job at Starbucks. This made me curious about finance and I resolved to one day understand "how banks work". 

In 2010 I was a PhD candidate working in Vienna, Austria and discovered I was really good at research. 

In 2014 I began working on financial audits of banking clients and in 2017 I qualified as an accountant.  

I'm on [Angel List](https://angel.co/john-mathews-3) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and my most recent projects are on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/johnmathews). My CV is available to [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2dxj_prWJiwUlZOaTRxNHYxa3c/view?usp=sharing).

Information about my work researching silos and granular flows can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md). If you'd like to know when I publish something new on this site, please [subscribe]({filename}../pages/subscribe.md) for updates!
