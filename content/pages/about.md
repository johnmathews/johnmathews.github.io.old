<br>
Iâ€™m an engineer (PhD, MEng) and a chartered accountant (ACA). I live in London and make a living by auditing banks.

I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and my most recent projects are on [github](http://www.github.com/johnmathews).

Information about my work investigating silos and granular flows at increased gravities can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md).
