#About
Thanks for visiting my blog. I'm an engineer working towards making finance more efficient, and the posts here show the winding path I've taken. 

In 2009 I graduated from Edinburgh University with a masters in Civil Engineering. The  [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) had arrived and I found a job at Starbucks. This made me curious about finance and I resolved to one day understand "how banks work". 

In 2010 I became a PhD candidate in Vienna, Austria and discovered I had a flare for research. 

In 2014 I began working on financial audits of banking clients and in 2017 I qualified as an accountant.  

I'm looking for opportunities to work on blockchain or dapp projects in order to make finance fairer, quicker and simpler.

I'm on [Angel List](https://angel.co/john-mathews-3) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmathews1), and my most recent projects are on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/johnmathews). My CV is available on [Google](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2dxj_prWJiwT09OS1lBN0hwa3M/view?usp=sharing) ([word]({attach}/documents/John_Mathews_CV.docx), [PDF]({attach}/documents/John_Mathews_CV.pdf)).

Information about my work researching silos and granular flows can be found [here]({filename}../articles/silos.md). If you'd like to know when I publish something new on this site, please [subscribe]({filename}../pages/subscribe.md) for updates!
