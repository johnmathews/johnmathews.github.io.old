Tweet: What to consider before buying Bitcoin
Summary: What to consider before buying Bitcoin

Recently a few friends have asked me how they can buy Bitcoin. Here are a few things that come to mind:

1. This is not financial advice, these are my opinions. Do everything at your own risk.

2. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

3. If the price falls 50%, you need to be able to wait whilst the price recovers

4. Write down the following:

   - How much you can afford to invest. Consider how much cash you will need over the next year, how long it would take to recover any losses, etc
   - How long you want to invest it for
   - How much you want to make

5. You will need to get good at identifying and ignoring the following, even from your friends:

   - Hype
   - Fake news 
   - Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD) 

   Don't trust. Verify.

6. Point 5 is really important and one of the best reasons to invest - money has an intensely psychological quality about it, and crypto currencies are the most intense trading experience there is right now. 

   By putting something you care about in a very risky situation (it is risky) you will need to control your psychology and identity when other people are trying to manipulate you. This is useful in all areas of life.

7. Almost no one has a clue what's happening. Conventional economists and traders certainly don't. This is crypto-economics.

8. Take some time to read about the fundamentals, understand the tech as much as you can, think about why people would behave in certain ways, what makes bitcoin special and useful, or not. Get started on this today, it will take some time before it begins to make sense.

   YouTube has a tonne of videos, and these two sites are good and detailed ([one](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), [two](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/)). 
   Twitter has a lot of good information but also a lot of bots and scammers spreading hype and FUD (see point 4). You can see who I follow on twitter.

9. [Coinbase](www.coinbase.com) is a user friendly and reputable exchange, there are other good exchanges too. 

10. If you're going to lose sleep over your investment, invest less.

11. Buy the dips, do your research, wait for the price to correct.  _BTC will correct_. The chart below shows the 20 day and 55 day moving average compared to the daily price. I expect that in early January (if not sooner) the price will return to between the 20 day and 55 day average. 

12. Don't make financial decisions when you're feeling rushed.

Leave a comment if you think I've missed something out or if you disagree.
