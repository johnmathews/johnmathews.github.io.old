Summary: How to pitch to a venture capitalist: Market + Management + Model + Momentum
Status: Published

I attended the [Lisbon Investment Summit](http://www.lis-summit.com/) in June and wrote about my experiences [here]({filename}../articles/20170609_lis17.md). One of the best sessions was with [Boris Golden](https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden) called "Understand Investment". These are my notes:

1. VC's are seeking to identify high-potential startups, and then support and fund them.
2. They are looking for something that is innovative and unproven.
3. A startup is not a company but an organisation searching for a business model,
4. Whilst executing and discovering a scalable way to grow.
5. Startups need money for ambitious but credible growth plans.
6. A typical stake for a VC could be roughly 20%.
7. VC's want an exit price of at least 100m, otherwise their business models don't work out.
8. $10m can seem a lot for a founder with a 30% stake, but it's not enough to attract VCs, so aim higher.
