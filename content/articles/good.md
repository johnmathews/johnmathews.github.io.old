Tweet: Don't try your hardest, use the least effort necessary to get as many things done as possible. 
Summary: Doing things that are good enough rather than perfect saves time and effort, allowing you to do more with the same resources.
Status: draft

One of the reasons I'm glad I studied engineering is because it taught me to solve problems pragmatically. Engineers use math and science to solve practical problems with limited resources. The limited resources force engineers to stop searching for perfect solutions, and focus simply on how to create the greatest net benefit. 

This approach has filtered into my everyday life and I think its one of the key reasons why I am so productive. My attitude can come over to some as reckless or lazy, but if a shortcut worksâ€¦ I don't think it is a shortcut. It's the main route, and the previous approach included a mistake. 

This contrasts with an attitude we often impress upon our children, to always try our hardest. Always trying our hardest, and trying to do each task or job as well as we possibly can, is wasteful. In the end you get less done and have wasted your precious time and effort focussing on things for longer than necessary.
