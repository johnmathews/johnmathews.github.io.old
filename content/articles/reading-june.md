Summary: A list of interesting things. June 1 - June 5

- [Mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) is a comprehensive list of mental models organised around different disciplines. Long read. Probably one of the most easy to apply and tangibly useful things I've read in a while.

- [Life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) - Is life actually short, or would we always want more time, no matter how much we could have?

- [Invisible asymptotes](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes) - A well written and long look at various facets of business strategy.

- [Factors from scratch](http://osam.com/Commentary/factors-from-scratch) - How factors work

- [This is tragic](https://kottke.org/18/06/a-sad-update-about-a-scissors-maker-that-went-viral) - "...But I do think this highlights the potential disconnects between mental health & business, publicity & success, and success & happiness.
