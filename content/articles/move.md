Summary: It's time to leave London, find a better life, andâ€¦

Ive always had the ambition to make my won money. When I was younger I'd joke with my dad about buying him a nice boat one day. Having learnt some finance, the argument for passive income is stronger than other and, inspired by Hazel English' latest EP, I'm leaving London and running away from things that don't make sense. I'm leaving my job  to try make money myself.

Its been an intense few months recently, with some weeks leaving me feeling ambitious and energetic, and others feeling stressed and overwhelmed. I need to get better at defining a goal, taking the quickest path there, and ignoring interesting distractions.

Ritsya (Mrs Mathews) is brave enough and imaginative enough to force me to think big and consider how to live a better life. My biggest fear is that I screw it up, shoot myself in the foot and shoot Ritsya and daughter in their feet also. We were headed safely to a very average existence and it would be terrible to swap that for something less. I don't think that's going to happen.

I know that I make better decisions and produce my best work under pressure, and I need to factor this in without using it as a reason to take on too much risk. Whilst I don't have a clear plan, or direction, or goal, (I have many of them) I've got skills and I want to see what I can do with them. I'll never do my best work, using my most valuable combination of skills, if I'm a cog in a machine or a tool to be used until its worn-out or depleted, ready to be replaced. 

## The pull

I dream of contributing some good to the world, and of using my skills to generate income directly, eventually gaining some passive income.

It feels insane that I might spend my most productive hours working hard to forge a career where I produce only a fraction of what I'm capable of. What would I have at the end of it all? A safe existence where I'm encouraged to believe things which don't matter really do.  

But it is safer being an employee than self-employed, and the price of removing "self-employment risks" is presumably the difference between the value you generate for your employer and what you're paid. 

But I think those risks are overpriced, and people are more capable than they give themselves credit for. Sometimes you have to walk into a situation to find out how you will make the most of it. And sometimes you have to leave in order to think clearly.

## The push

Last year my boss gave me some advice that was supposed to be encouraging. I'd requested to reduce my involvement with some stuff that was unrelated to my role so that I could contribute more to my team and still maintain some semblance of a work/life balance. 

My boss was pretty clear that reducing my involvement in the extra "stuff" would not be possible. During our conversation he advised me not to worry about how much I contributed to the team, because "the work will get done anyway". This was meant to be encouraging, but instead relieved me of any conviction that the work I did was important. 

It's true though - no matter how many things go wrong, the deliverables will be delivered and the deadlines will be met, usually due to a lot of effort by juniors[^1]. Its advantageous for management to encourage the belief that a junior employee has ownership of a process, but a junior usually doesn't (because they are junior) and cannot control the things for which they're encouraged to feel responsible. Corporations take advantage of irrationally committed employees exhausting themselves in exchange for fuzzy promises about future rewards. I'm not ok with that, it's destructive and inhumane. The people around me don't look happy, they look stressed.	

[^1]: I find the description of a corporate as a Ponzi scheme where the resource transferred is time instead of money to be compelling.
