# Blogging using Pelican

This blog is built using Pelican, an open source static site generator written in Python. A static site can only serve HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is all I need for a blog. The comments will update dynamically courtesy of the DISQUS service. This means the comments are stored externally.

I write content and create all the required files on my local machine, and then upload the output to a server. This is a faster way to create and edit content because I can preview changes without waiting for a remote server to process my requests. 

In the past I've used WordPress, which is great. - With almost no effort you can set up an effective blog and begin to publish content. I began to blog last summer, first on a WordPress.com site, then on my own domain with a WordPress installation, and really enjoyed seeing my own content on the Internet. But you sacrifice control and performance for accessibility. 

But I soon found that there is a trade-off with control. I felt like I was compromising because I couldn't control the design. It's amazing that with so many free themes to choose from, it's almost impossible to find one that met all my criteria. 

My criteria were simple, I thought:

1. A clean 1 column layout
2. A simple header with links to an about page and a contact page
3. No junk in the footer
