# Flee

</br>

Summer children

Squeel and shriek,

Watch wars.

Excitement mounts.

</br>

Exotic.

</br>

Unexpectedly,

Death arrives.

</br>

Grow up

Grow old

Face death 

Dodge evil.

</br>

Don't tire.

</br>

World is fragile.

Towers burn,

Bridges bludgeon,

Markets stab.

</br>

Got to get out.
