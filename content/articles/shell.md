Tweet: Measure how slow you shell is and find out which components are causing the biggest delays
Summary: zsh was loading significantly slower than bash, so I used profiling to see what was slowing things down

Opening up a new shell was annoyingly slow. Not terrible, but enough to notice. Its a niggle.

I wanted to find out which components were causing the most delay, so I used
`time` to measure how long it took to launch a shell. Even though shells
might appear to be part of the low level 'guts' of a computer, each shell is
just an executable and can be treated as such.

To measure the startup speed of your shell, do:
``` zsh
for i in $(seq 1 10); do /usr/bin/time $SHELL -i -c exit; done
```

![zsh profile]({static}/images/zsh_startup_speed.jpg)

This shows that it takes 0.84 seconds to start `zsh` - not terrible, but not
great:

You can compare the performance of different shells by replacing `$SHELL` with
`zsh`, `bash`, `fish` etc.

Here are the results if I used `BASH` instead of `zsh` - 9.3x faster! (but
without useful tools and plugins):

Now that I can measure how long it takes to start, it would be useful to know
which proccesses are causing the greatest delays. This could be done with
something like `zsh -xv` which enables verbose output and xtrace. This creates
a tonne of output, but doesnt inlcude timestamps. All I really want is
a summary of how much time each subproccess required to run, i.e. an order blind profiler.

Add `zmodload zsh/zprof` at the start of `.zshrc` and `zprof` at the very end.
Now when I start `zsh` I see the following:

Next steps - make virtualenvwrapper run faster, or asyncronously, or
not at all...

Update:
`virtualenvwrapper` is the biggest cause of slow loading. Using the [lazy
loadin](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) option decreased loading time by 0.3s
