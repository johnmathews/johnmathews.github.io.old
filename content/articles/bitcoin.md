Summary: I predict Bitcoin will become a safe haven asset comparable to gold

A safe haven asset is something to buy when there is short term economic insecurity. Historically, the safest asset you can buy has been gold. This is not because of anything inherently special about gold, but because that is what people believe to be the most reliable long term method of storing value. 

People believe gold is special because they assume that in future other people will believe it's special.

### Criteria for a safe haven asset

A safe-haven asset must fulfil the following criteria:

1. It's price can't be controlled by a government, bank or anyone else. The market is spread out beyond the reach of any one organisation. This helps make it a safer asset than something backed by government or bank.
2. It's supply can't be controlled by a government, bank or anyone else - it exists naturally and the rate at which it's produced or traded is beyond the control of any one organisation. 
3. Supply is naturally limited. The effort required to create the asset naturally limits the supply.
4. The asset doesn't wear out or expire.
5. It's difficult to fake.
6. (Almost) everyone considers it to be precious and valuable, so its easy to find a buyer to negotiate a price with.
7. It can be stored and transported simply. It's not delicate or volatile.

For these reasons, and because of historical consensus, people have been happy to use gold as a store of value in times of economic uncertainty and for long durations. Silver also meets these requirement.

### Bitcoin compared to gold

Consider why gold is so good as a safe haven asset and long term value store. For all the reasons above, bitcoin is better, except one: At present, not many people consider it to be precious and valuable, so the market is small. This will change as confidence and awareness increases.

The fundamentals are already established:

1. A decentralised network ensures that it can't be regulated, controlled by a single government or organisation. It can't be turned off.
2. The present and future rate of supply is publicly available and inviolable. This increases market efficiency and creates more rational pricing than a market where the rate of supply is unverifiable.
3. Supply is naturally (mathematically) limited using proof of work algorithms. 
4. It doesn't wear out.
5. It's impossible to fake.
6. It can be stored and transported more easily than gold. - If you can remember 12 words you can transport all your bitcoin effortlessly where ever you go.
