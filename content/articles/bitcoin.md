Summary: Bitcoin will become a better safe haven asset than gold

Historically, the ultimate safe haven asset has always been gold. This is not because of anything inherently special about gold, but simply because that is what people believe is the most reliable long term method of storing value. 

People believe gold is special because they assume that in future other people will believe it's special. It could be silver, or copper, or some other naturally occurring material.

### Criteria for a safe haven asset

1. It's price can't be controlled by a government, bank or anyone else, because its spread out beyond the reach of any one organisation. 
2. It's supply can't be controlled by a government, bank or anyone else - it exists naturally and the rate at which it is produced or traded is beyond the control of any one organisation. 
3. Supply is naturally limited because it takes effort to extract it from the earth. The required effort naturally limits the supply.
4. It doesn't wear out or expire.
5. It's difficult to fake.
6. (Almost) everyone considers it to be precious and valuable, so its easy to find a buyer to negotiate a price with.
7. It can be stored and transported simply. It's not delicate or volatile.

For these reasons, and because of historical consensus, people have been happy to treat gold as if its very valuable, and use it as a long term store of value. Silver also meets these requirements, but (presumably) is a bit more abundant than gold and therefore is less expensive.

### Bitcoin compared to gold

Consider why gold is so good as a safe haven and long term value store. For all the reasons above, bitcoin is better. Except for one: At present, not many people consider it to be precious and valuable, so the market is small. This will change as confidence and awareness increases.

The fundamentals are already established:

1. A decentralised network ensures that it can't be regulated or controlled, and therefore it is safer than asset controlled by a single government or organisation
2. The present and future rate of supply is publicly available and inviolable. This increases market efficiency and creates more rational pricing than a market where the future rate of supply is unverifiable.
3. Supply is naturally (mathematically) limited using proof of work algorithms. 
4. It doesn't wear out.
5. It's impossible to fake.
6. It can be stored and transported more easily than gold. - If you can remember 12 words you can transport all your bitcoin effortlessly where ever you go.
