My negative experiences of corporate culture have been both disempowering and ridiculous. Lowlights include: 

- Being treated like cannon-fodder:
  - The better a companies brand, the greater the number of applicants over the number of graduate roles being offered. Graduates generally don't realise that the graduate recruitment campaigns are marketing and believe most of the hype.
  - There is information asymmetry at many levels in a corporation. One example is the contract between the expectations of graduates as they join the firm and the reality they encounter once the initial on-boarding has completed. 
  - The reality is an oversupply of cheap motivated labor that doesn't realise how profitable it is. Graduates can be worked to near breaking point because they let themselves, believing it to be reasonable.
- The risk adjusted return on your contribution
- Milking station
- Its not as bad as a Syria
- Politics
- Self-interest
- Disenfranchised
- Innovation is slow
- Beauracracy
