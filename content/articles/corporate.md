## Wall of text [1st draft]

Having made arrangements to leave my job and move out of London, it seems like a reasonable time to reflect on the last 3.5 years. 

When I first arrived I had no idea what I was getting into, and no idea what a corporate culture would be like. I was coming from academia and my motivation for moving into finance could be summed up in two points:

1. Understand more about the 2008 financial crisis
2. Get paid more for using mostly the same skills as in academia


There's nothing wrong with these motivations but it's hardly a comprehensive or long term approach to career planning. 

When I started I was surprised at the 6 weeks of induction, and being given my very own laptop - I guess I just assumed I'd have a desk and a desktop like previously. 

Hot desking took a while to get used to - and gave a very nomadic feel to working life. As an auditor you are frequently working at a client so having a laptop makes sense, and when you are back in your own office you can be at any desk thats free, albeit you are supposed be in a certain area. 

I went into the job with a high opinion of my employer and a committed attitude. I'd escaped the tyranny of capricious professors and unreliably research grants, and had moved back to my home country to contribute to the system that educated me and settle into a regular job with predictable pay. 

I hadn't bothered to check what the pay increases would be, as it wouldn't have altered my decision to accept a graduate role, but I remember being amazed when I was told how fast the pay would increase. I remember thinking that I'd never need more than the salary I'd be earning once I qualified as an accountant, - what I'm earning now. Turns out that was pretty short sighted. 

A phrase that kept coming to mind in those first few months was "accountant factory". When I walked past the banks of desks filled with graduates working on their laptops (with their little screens and excel sheets full of *tiny* numbers). And also as we did induction courses that were entirely scripted, and had every last detail mapped out - we were being processed through a system. Graduates in, corporate accounts out. The reach and magnitude of the company is huge, and apparently so are the scaling efficiencies that come with it. When I arrived I was impressed there were free biscuits. Now I ignore anything scripted or addressed to a mailing list. 

In the first few months, the biggest shock was starting the exams for the ACA chartered accountancy qualification. Naively I had believed that the professional qualification wouldn't be a big deal and I didn't give any thought to it when I applied - I just wanted to find out how banks worked and get paid a decent salary - if there some exams to be done then whatever, fine, I had a PhD and I was sure I could handle it. 

That turned out to be a massive mistake. The alarm bells should have rung loudly when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so that they could get the qualification. Doing the pre course work before college showed me I couldn't just wing it. (college… they were taking us out of the office and paying to put us in a classroom to prepare for these exams…) 

Starting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant, without considering the effort and time involved to qualify was really dumb. It's an oversight I struggle to comprehend. But that's hindsight, and I know I'm not the only one who did it. 

The disappointment and sadness at having to study again was profound. The teaching and assessment style was several steps behind what I'd become used to. Compared to the depth, autonomy and research-focus of a doctorate, writing cookie-cutter essays in ultra time-pressured exams felt dumb and shallow. The exams were also incredibly hard and because of my low morale I failed several of the harder exams, and this led to more weekends and annual leave being spent away from my wife and stuck in libraries and offices. 

It was miserable, and the only effective way I could find to study productively and not be so sad that I couldn't focus was to shut out the present and close down emotionally for the months leading up to a set of exams. Then I'd have a few months reprieve until it started again. 

It's hard to say what effect this has had, but I know its required a huge amount of patience and generosity from my wife, who having not seen me for long periods of time during my doctorate studies thought we were going to have a normal lifestyle when we came to London. It put a lot of stress on me too, as I paused my social life and other interests, and then tried to rush back to them when I had the time, knowing that soon I'd have to pause them again. 

If I hadn't already done a doctorate this would have been exciting and felt valuable and special. But I'd done enough exams to know that they're never as important as they're made out to be, and whatever it was that was missing from my life wasn't going to be found in completing another set of exams. Perhaps I should have quit, it required so much loneliness and misery that even though its over now and I'm a qualified accountant I feel nothing but numbness and a lingering regret for how different the last 3 years could have been. Sure I wouldn't know as much about business or finance (and I'm really glad to know what I've learnt), but things could have been so much more pleasant in the present, and Im exhausted of deferring present comfort in favour of future non-specific benefits.  

There's been a lot of time on trains, too - my door to desk commute is about 1 hour each way, and I've never lived somewhere in London that hasn't felt transient. We've needed to be near a train station and didn't want to commute more than an hour and I guess that's put us in a certain kind of neighbourhood. We're surrounded by other young professionals who also don't have any intention to stay in the city, who are looking to move on and move up as fast as possible. 

Because there are so many people with attitudes and priorities like my own in London, I want to leave. That's a fairly gutting realisation. 

Back in the office I soon began to figure out how people were organised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. My firm operates a "matrix style" org structure and I think it took me about a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years to feel like I could do my job. There is a huge difference between the branded messages that are communicated by leadership through emails and meetings, and the decisions made by individuals that are only visible to a particular few. 

My experience has been that the culture is incredibly cut-throat and selfish, though I don't think academia is any less selfish[^1], and the construction industry certainly isn't. But the pace of financial services in London gives the aggression an edge that is frankly dehumanising. I often wonder if the only way people can endure it is if they've not experienced anything else, and think it normal or ok to live like that.

Corporate finance appears clean, and well presented. The people are dependable and capable, and the pressure to conform is almost palpable. It is the most sanitised existence I've ever endured. Once you scratch the veneer and experience the prioritisation of profit over humanity, it is repulsive. 

From within glass and steel temples I can read about the Middle East imploding, or migrants from Africa being washed up in the Med, or tower blocks burning, and despite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we don't ask each other how we can help. We feel powerless to help, because apparently we do not know how, despite our wealth, talents and education. We work hard to keep things the same, as we clamber over each other and up a corporate ladder. 

The folks at the top are almost always tired white men whose bodies appear to be suffering, and I remember watching some of them leave the office one day and thinking "If you gave this firm your whole life and died after decades of service, there would be no evidence you were ever here after a few weeks". The work will get done regardless, and the market forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. And the city will carry on, fighting to maintain it's dominance, which serves the interests of those who hold power over those who want it for themselves. 

I'm done. 



[ ^1]: Publications trump almost all other metrics, and the incentives to publish quantity over quality are such that risky or slow research equates to career suicide - the number of researchers seems much greater than the number of funding options available, and the metrics used to standardise success and allocate resources can be subverted just as well in academia as in any other industry. What management measure, the team prioritises above all else. Most journal papers are written with the authors benefits in mind far more than the readers.
