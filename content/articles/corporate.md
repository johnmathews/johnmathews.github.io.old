# 2014 - 2017

Having made arrangements to leave London, it seems like a reasonable time to reflect on my time here. 

London is a tough city to live in — its big enough that a sub 1-hour commute is considered good, and is generally [expensive]({filename}../articles/london.md) without any big lifestyle benefits. My time in London has been defined by my quest to complete my graduate scheme in financial services. 

When I first arrived I had no idea what London would be like or what life in a corporate would be like. I was coming from academia and my motivation for moving into finance could be summed up in two points:

1. Understand more about the 2008 financial crisis
2. Get paid more for using mostly the same skills (math) as in engineering


I don't this there's any wrong with these motivations but hindsight has shown this wasn't a great way to plan a career. 

When I started  my job I was surprised at the 6 weeks of induction, and hot-desking took a while to get used to. Life as auditor felt quite nomadic, as everyone would spend large amount of time at clients, and no-one has their own desk in our office. 

I went into the job with a high opinion of my employer and the view that I would be working here for several years. Having escaped the financial insecurity of needing to win short-term research grants, I'd moved back to my home country to contribute to the system that educated me. I was happy to have a regular job with a decent and predictable salary.  

A phrase that kept coming to mind in those first few months was "accountant factory". Our courses were entirely scripted and mapped out - training was a standardised process, and we were being processed. Graduates in, corporate accounts out. 

The company is huge and so are the scaling efficiencies (and barriers to competition) that come with this. When I arrived (fresh from an academic research institute) I was impressed there were free biscuits, and it felt presumptuous to put a meeting in someones diary. Now I ignore any communications addressed to a mailing list. 

## Accountant

In the first few months, the biggest shocks were related to the accountancy qualification. Naively I had believed that the qualification wouldn't be a big deal and I didn't give any thought to it when I applied — I just wanted to find out how banks worked. If there were some exams to be done then it would be fine, I'd already achieved a PhD and I would handle it. 

That turned out to be a massive mistake. A huge mistake. The alarm bells should have rung louder when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so that they could get the qualification (and were already intending to leave asap afterwards). Doing the pre-course work before college showed me I couldn't just wing it. College - I was being sent to a classroom again. We were being taken out of the office, away from clients, and put in a classroom to prepare for these exams… 

Starting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant, without considering the effort and time involved to qualify was really dumb. It's an oversight I struggle to comprehend. But hindsight is no way to assess decision making ability. 

The disappointment and sadness at having to study again was profound. The teaching and assessment style was several steps behind what I'd become used to. Compared to the depth, autonomy and research-focus of a doctorate, writing cookie-cutter essays in time-pressured exams felt stupid. The exams were incredibly hard, and I failed several of them, probably because of my low morale whilst revising. Retaking them required more weekends and annual leave being spent away from my family, camped-out in libraries and offices. 

This required much patience and generosity from Ritsya, who having not seen me for long periods during my doctorate expected us to have a more normal lifestyle when we came to London. I found it miserable to pause my social life and other interests whilst studying, and then I would try to rush back to them when I had the time, knowing that soon I'd have to pause them again. 

If I hadn't already studied in Vienna, this process of working and studying in London would have been exciting and felt valuable or special. I'd done enough exams though to know that they're never as important as they're made out to be, and whatever it was that was missing from my life wasn't going to be found in another qualification. 

On the upside though, the ACA is the most practical qualification I've gained and has taught me many useful aspects of business and finance. I'm glad to finally see business not as some mysterious system but something attainable and understandable. 

## Neighbourhood

Living in London has also required a lot of time on trains — my door to desk commute is about an hour each way, and I've never lived somewhere in London that hasn't felt transient. We've needed to live near a station and didn't want to commute more than an hour and that's put us in neighbourhoods with other young professionals who also don't have long term plans (or ability) to stay in the city. We're all looking to move on and move up as fast as possible, and because there are so many people with attitudes and priorities like my own in London, I want to leave. 

## Corporate Culture

Back in the office I spent the first few months figuring out how people were organised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. My firm operates a "matrix style" org structure and I think it took me about a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years to feel like I could do my job. There is a difference between how things are spoken about, and how things actually happen. 

My experience has been that performance is all that matters, and behaviours are defined by self-interest. I don't think academia is any different[^1], and the construction industry certainly isn't. I often wonder if the only way people can endure it is if they've not experienced anything else, or think it normal or ok, or necessary. I find myself wishing we could be kinder to each other, and that we could create structures that incentivise mutual support.

Corporate finance usually appears clean and well presented. Its people appear dependable and capable. The culture is sanitised and the pressure to conform is ubiquitous. If you don't conform, or you cannot perform as required, profit is prioritised above all else and you will be discarded.

I came to see my office as a glass and steel temple. I read about the Middle East, and migrants from Africa trying to arrive in Europe, and tower blocks burning, and felt really disconnected. 

Despite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we don't ask each other how we can help. Maybe we are too busy, or feel powerless to help. Apparently we do not know how to, despite our wealth, talents, education and connections. 

I remember watching a man leave the office one day and thought that if he gave his whole career and left after decades of service, there would be no evidence of him after a few weeks. The work will always get done. Market forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. The City carries on. 

[ ^1]: Publications trump almost all other metrics, and the incentives to publish quantity over quality are such that risky or slow research is inexcusable. The metrics used to standardise success and allocate resources can be subverted just as well in academia as in any other industry. What management measures, the team prioritises above all else. Most journal papers are written with the authors benefits in mind far more than the readers.
