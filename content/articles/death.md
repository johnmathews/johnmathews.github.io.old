Summary: Given our 100% mortality rate, death is conspicuously absent from our conversations and thoughts.

In 100 years I will be dead, and so will my children. It is likely that no-one will know that I ever existed, except perhaps a few grand-children. I have a limited amount of time to live, do stuff, and experience the world. This limitation should result in vastly different behaviour than if I had unlimited time. 

This limitation is normal. This is the way that life works. I didn't choose to be born - I certainly didn't choose where or when and I didn't chose the family or circumstances I was born into - but now that I'm here, it feels deeply unnatural to consider that I will be entirely forgotten and leave without a trace. It would be easy to use the few years that I have chasing the creation of some sort of legacy, some sort of functional immortality. 

Maybe I could create some amazing technology, solve some difficult problems, or be an incredible leader. But when I think about people who have done some of these things and have since died, I realise that they are still certainly dead, and everyone has much better things to do than think about how great they were.

No matter how hard I try, or don't try, I will still wake up and go to sleep a few thousand times before expiring. I will marvel at the suns warmth and the beauty of mountains and oceans. I will get hungry and cold, and enjoy eating and drinking. I will spend time with my family, and watch my children grow. And I will get old, and weak, and die. The work I did as a younger man will likely still be being done.

I hope that I laugh a lot with my friends and family when I am old, and I hope that I prioritise laughing with them now over doing something which has no consequence.
