Summary: Given our 100% mortality rate, death is conspicuously absent from our conversations and thoughts.
Status: Draft

No matter how much I try to achieve, or don't try, I will still wake up and go to sleep a few thousand times before I inevitably die. I will marvel at the suns warmth and the beauty of mountains and oceans. I will get hungry and cold, and enjoy eating and drinking. I'll spend time with my family, and watch my children grow. And I will get old, and weak, and die. The work I did as a younger man will likely still be being done.

In 100 years I'll be long gone, so will my children. It is likely that no-one alive will know that I ever existed, except perhaps a few grand-children.

I have a limited amount of time to live, do things, and experience the world. This limitation should result in vastly different behaviour than if I had unlimited time. 

It feels deeply unnatural to consider that I will be entirely forgotten and leave no trace. It would be easy to use the few years that I have to chase the creation of some sort of legacy in order to achieve some sort of functional immortality. 

Maybe I could create some amazing technology, solve really difficult problems, or be an incredible leader. But when I think about people who have done some of these things and have since died, I realise that they are still certainly dead, and everyone currently alive has much better things to do than think about how great they were.

I hope that I laugh a lot with my friends and family when I'm old, and I hope that I prioritise being with them now, rather than doing something which has no consequence.
