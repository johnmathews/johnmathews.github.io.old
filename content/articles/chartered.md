Summary: I've qualified as a chartered accountant and will soon become a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
Status:

Earlier this year I qualified as a chartered accountant. Qualification requires passing 15 exams and gaining 3150 hours of work experience. 

To celebrate passing your exams and verify your success, the ICAEW print the names of everyone who passed in an advert in the Financial Times. This happened for me on the 26 January.
