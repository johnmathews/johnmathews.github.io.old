For years I've wished that I could wake up early and use the quiet
pre-breakfastÂ hours for distraction-free productivity. And for years I
have spectacularly failed at this. I love the quiet, distraction-free
hours at the end of the day too, as well as waking up slowly.[^1] 

Many famous leaders and politicians are known to start their days early,
and I would like to be able to do this too. After years of trying and
failing, I have had a break-through.

The secret of waking up early is this:

Become a parent.

After the first couple of months with a new-born:

-   You will be well-practiced at quickly waking up at previously
    unthinkable times
-   You will be used to operating on less sleep than you ever thought
    possible
-   Your beautiful child will become a reliable alarm clock, waking you
    up at the crack of dawn with cute smiles and increasingly insistent
    demands that you get up, play and make breakfast.

[^1]: If you have the freedom to begin sleeping and working when you want, I still believe this is a great option. I bashed out a PhD in 3.5 years during which I usually woke up late and began to work around lunch time! - Glorious autonomy!
