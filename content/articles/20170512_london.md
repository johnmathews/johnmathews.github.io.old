Summary:

Living in London is expensive, everyone in the UK knows this. Everyone knows that property in London is expensive, too. We all enjoy talking about that.

I've lived here for 3 years now, and when my wife and I were both working we lived comfortably. Two salaries under one roof is just fine. Not as fine as in another city, such as Vienna for example, but perfectly reasonable. Just over a year ago my first child was born, and now that my wife's maternity pay has ended we are a single income household. This is not fine. Even though I earn almost £50k/year, and any salary increase is taxed at 45%, I cannot cover essential costs on my higher tax-rate salary. I'm in the 45% tax bracket, and my basic outgoings are £400 greater than income each month. This is messed up.

Salaries and living expenses have become really disconnected. For ordinary people, saving money for a deposit on a house is impossible, because the money must be spent on rent. It's a trap - repayments on a mortgage are cheaper than paying rent, but you cannot save enough for a deposit because 

1. So much of your salary goes to paying the rent
2. The average London property costs £400k, and 10% (or even just 5%) of that could easily be a years salary.
