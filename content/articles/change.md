Summary: I want to find out what I'm really capable of. I'm leaving my corporate job in search of a better life.

I'm leaving London and running away from things that don't make sense. I'm leaving my job  to try make money myself.

Being "professionally unattached" gets harder as financial overheads increase, but my wife is brave enough and imaginative enough to force me to think big and consider how to live a better life. My biggest fear is that I screw it up, shoot myself in the foot and shoot my wife and daughter in their feet also. We are currently headed safely to a very average existence. It would be terrible to swap that for something less. I don't think that's going to happen.

I make better decisions and produce my best work under pressure. Whilst I don't have a clear plan, or direction, or goal, (I have many of them) I've got skills and I want to see what I can do with them. I'll never do my best work if I'm a cog in a machine or a tool to be used until its worn-out or depleted, ready to be replaced. 

## The pull

I dream of using my skills to generate income directly, and passively, and not as someone else's employee. 

It feels insane that I might spend my most productive hours working hard to forge a career where I receive only a fraction of what I'm worth, and produce only a fraction of what I could. What would I have at the end of it all? A safe and mediocre existence where I pretend that things which don't matter really do.  

It's safer being an employee than self-employed, and the price of removing "self-employment risks" is presumably the difference between the value you generate and what you're paid. 

But I think those risks are overpriced, and people are more capable than they give themselves credit for. Sometimes you have to walk into a situation to find out how you will make the most of it. And sometimes you have to leave a situation in order to think clearly.

## The push

Last year my boss gave me some advice that was supposed to be encouraging. I'd requested to reduce my involvement with some stuff that was unrelated to my role, so that I could contribute more to my team and maintain some semblance of a work/life balance. 

My boss was pretty clear that reducing my involvement in the extra "stuff" would not be possible. During our conversation he advised me not to worry about how much I contributed to the team, because "the work will get done anyway". This was meant to be encouraging, but left me gutted me of any conviction that the work I did was important. 

It's true though - no matter how many things go wrong, the deliverables will be delivered and the deadlines will be met, usually due to a lot of effort by juniors[^1]. Its advantageous for management to encourage the belief that a junior employee has ownership of a process, but a junior usually doesn't (because they are junior) and cannot control the things for which they're encouraged to feel responsible. Corporations take advantage of irrationally committed employees exhausting themselves in exchange for fuzzy promises about future rewards. I'm not ok with that, it's destructive and inhumane. The people around me don't look happy, they look rich and stressed.	

[^1]: I find the description of a corporate as a Ponzi scheme where the resource transferred is time instead of money to be compelling.
