Summary:

Digital currencies, and the digital ledger technologies that underpin them are in their infancy. Widespread adoption is hampered by user experience and by technical limitations. Two technical limitations of digital ledgers are: 

1. Tranasaction volume
2. A scalable, flexible Smart Contract implementation to automatically settle transactions

The AEternity project is aiming to overcome these limitations using State Channels, an 'Oracle Machine' (the first ever, as far as I can tell) and a,b,c,.

Here I will discuss the prblem of transaction volume, by first explaining the present state of the art. Bitcoin has a 6 minute settlement time, and cannot support more than X transactions per second because of Y, Z, W. To resolve this, the Bitcoin "Lightning Network" is being developed. This seeks to increase the networks tranaction volume by A and B. 

Etherium was designed to implement high transaction volumes and smart contracts, however its smart contract functionality is limited because of A, B. Its maximum transaction volume is X and is limited by Etheriums E, F, G. 

AEternity has the following critia, and this means â€¦...
