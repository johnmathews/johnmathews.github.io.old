##  Overall

- Energy levels have been low almost all week - I have only worked out once when I initially intended to exercise everyday. I am sleeping a lot, and working intensely all the time. I have a lot to think about, so I guess this is making me feel like I don't want to do regular exercise. Last year I stopped when I started to study as I didn't feel I could focus on it maybe this is the same. 
- Diet this week has been ok as I have avoided eating junk, but hasn't had a lot of fresh vegetables or fruit. This may have led to low energy levels.
- Tuesday and Wednesday were the low points for missing Ritsya and Vienna. Thursday and Friday have seemed to go quicker, and I was encouraged and excited to have interesting and unexpected conversations with Arub, Crypto, InsureX. 
- Ritsya suggested I could spend some time praying or even fasting about the next few months. I think this is a good idea, and whilst I have prayed repeatedly and purposefully, I haven't done so as much as I might have. 

### Music
