# Felix Culpa 

by Kings Kaleidoscope

<br>
Turn the lights on, look at what I have <br>
See the twisted trophies of a dead man  <br>
Countless stories, tell of sin and pain <br>
But they sing the sweetness of my savior’s grace <br>

I’m a torn man, spirit fighting flesh <br>
There’s a battle raging deep in my chest <br>
But all that haunts me, all that leaves a stain <br>
Only sings the sweetness of my savior’s grace<br>

A fortunate fall, my sins are stories of grace to recall <br>
A fortunate fall, I glory in my sins forgiven<br>

Jesus bought me, and now I am His <br>
Dying with Him, in His death I now live <br>
All my vices, to which I was chained <br>
Only speak the sweetness of my savior’s grace<br>

A fortunate fall, my sins are stories of grace to recall <br>
A fortunate fall, I glory in my sins forgiven<br>

And still I’m a wicked, wretched man <br>
I do everything I hate <br>
I am fighting to be god<br>
I seethe and claw and thrash and shake <br>
I have killed and stacked the dead<br>
on a throne from which I reign <br>
In the end I just want blood <br>
and with His blood my hands are stained <br>

See the God who reigns on high <br>
He has opened His own veins <br>
From His wounds a rushing torrent that can wash it all away <br>
Grace upon grace, upon grace upon grace<br>
