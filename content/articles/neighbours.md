Tweet: Three generations to forget what was previously cherished.
Summary: Humans deserve respect, simply because they are human. This truth is in the process of going from self evident, to assumed, to denied.

A useful model I've come across states that it takes three generations for a society to deny something previously considered true. The first generation studies or experiences something which leads to a particluar value or belief. The second generation inherits the belief and assumes it to be true, but doesnt arrive at the belief through their own critical thought. The third generation then questions the assumption, realises that most holders of the belief do not have a good basis for their belief, and disregards it. 

The belief that people have a reponsibility to look after each other and treat each other with a minimum level of respect seems to be following this route.  

That humans inherantly deserve a degree of respect and dignity simply because they are human is self-evident. In times of comfort and excess it could be ignored, but in times of calamity and in the aftermath of disasters it becomes undeniable and obvious. This is partly because disasters reveal our instinct for justice and our frailty in the face of misfortune.

Life is exerienced through the lens of the mind, and its percpetion is mostly governed by funadamental circumstances or desires. The trappings of a prosperous society allows this reality to be covered by a veneer of soft arguments, or rejected in favor of a viewpoint that says we have superseded these suposedly basic origins. 

Good leaders should know better. They should study history and be self-aware. In the past they have forgotten this reality and have been forced to relearn it at great cost. Are we about to forget, again, and let our children live with those consequences?

My grandfathers generation saw the damage that sectarian systems bring, and were forced to answer questions around how much respect people deserve only because they are people. As the consequences of different views and systems became evident, my fathers generation assumed the answers to be self-evident, because the consequences of the previous "forgetting" were still clear. 

Who is clearly articulating this now? This year? 

When we disucss taxation, social mobility, migration, military intervention, why do we not start with the assumedly self-evident truth that people are inherantly valuable and important? Humans are more than metrics, and cannot be entirely evaluated using only quantitative methods. 

Horton, the title charachter in "Horton Hears a Who" by Dr. Zeuss, undestodd this. He went to great lengths to protect the tiny and weak people in who-ville. We teach this truth to our children, but do not demonstrate it as adults. Jesus also understood it. He said that we should love our neighbours, and explained that our neighbours are people we come across who need our help.

I wonder if forgetting that humans are inherantly worthy of respect is a prerequisite for declining;

- standards of governance

- social mobility

- peace

- economic growth

Which makes me think it is a self defeating deception. When we choose to disregard a group of humans because it is inconvenient to help them, we are elevating our needs above theirs. This seems to create chains of events where everybody suffers.
