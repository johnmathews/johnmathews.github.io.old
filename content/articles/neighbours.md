Tweet: Three generations to forget what was previously cherished.
Summary: Humans deserve respect, simply because they are human. This simple truth has gone from being self evident, to assumed, to forgotten.

A useful model I've come across states that it takes three generations to
forget something. The first generation studies or experiences something
which leads to a particluar point of view, value or belief. The second generation assume it to be true and do not arrive at the belief through their own effort. The third generation then forgets or denies that which their parents took for granted and what their grandparents studied or experienced.

I believe that people have a reponsibility to look after each other and treat each other with at least a minimum level of respect. 

This point of view appears to be being forgotten. Because it used to be assumed, it is not being promoted as it should. 

I think that this belief - that humans inherantly deserve a degree of respect and dignity, for no other reason than because they are human - is self-evident. In times of comfort and excess it can be ignored, but in times of calamity or in the aftermath of disasters it becomes undeniable and obvious. This is partly because disasters reveal our instinct for justice and our frailty in the face of misfortune.

Life is exerienced through the lens of the mind, and its percpetion is governed by funadamental and simple circumstances or desires. The trappings of a prosperous society and culture allows this reality to be ignored or rejected in favor of a viewpoint that says we have superseded these origins. 

But good leaders should know better. In the past they have forgotten this reality and relearnt it at great cost. Are we about to forget, again, and let our children live with those consequences?

My grandfathers generation saw the damage that sectarian systems bring, and were forced to answer questions around how much respect people deserve only because they are people. As the consequences of different views and systems became evident, my fathers generation assumed the answers to be self evident, because the consequences of the previous "forgetting" were still vivid. Who is clearly articulating this now? this year? 

When we disucss taxation, social mobility, migration, military intervention, why do we not start with the assumedly self-evident truth that people are inherantly valuable and important? Humans are more than metrics, and cannot be entirely evaluated using quantitative methods and KPIs.

Horton the elephant, the title charachter in "Horton Hears a Who" by Dr. Zeuss, gets it. He went to great lengths to protect the tiny and weak people in who-ville. Jesus gets it. He said that we should love our neighbours, and even told us that our neighbours are people we come across who need our help.

I wonder if forgetting that humans are inherantly worthy of respect is a prerequisite for declining;
- standards of governance
- social mobility
- peace
- economic growth

Which makes me think it is a self defeating blindness. When we choose to disregard a group of humans because it is inconvenient to help them, we are elevating our needs above theirs. Ultimately this seems to create a chain of events where everybody suffers.
