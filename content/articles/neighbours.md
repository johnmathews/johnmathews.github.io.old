A useful model i've come across states that it takes three generations to
forget something. The first generation studies or experiences something
which leads to a particluar point of view, value or belief. The second generation assume it to be true and do not arrive at their belief through their own effort. The third generation then forgets or denies the belief or value which their parents took for granted and which their grandparents studied.

I believe that we have a reponsibility to look after each other, and treat each other with at least a minimum level of respect. 

This point of view appears to be being forgotten or taken for granted, and (as far as I can tell) is not being supported or pushed forward. 

I think that this belief - that humans inherantly deserve a degree of respect and dignity, for no other reason than because they are human - is self-evident and undeniable in times of calamity or in the aftermath of disasters. This is partly because disasters reveal our instinct for justice and our frailty in the face of "bad luck".

Much of life is psycological, untamed, about funadamental and simple circumstances or desires. The trappings of society and culture allows this reality to be ignored, or rejected in favor of a viewpoint that says we have superseded these more primitive origins. But good leaders should know better. In the past they have forgotten this reality and relearnt it at great cost. Are we now about to forget, and let our children live with those consequences, again?

My grandfathers generation would have considered it self evident that people deserve respect because they are people. My fathers generation assumed it to be self evident, because the consequences of the previous "forgetting" were still vivid. Who is clearly articulating this now? this year? 

When we disucss taxation, social mobility, mogration, military intervention, why do we not start with the assumedly self-evident truth that people are inherantly valuable and important?

Horton, the title charachter in "Horton Hears a Who" by Dr. Zeuss, gets it. Jesus gets it. He said that we should love our neighbours, and even told us who our neighbours are. They are people we come across who need our help.

I wonder if forgetting that humans are inherantly worthy of respect is a prerequisite for declining:
- standards of governance
- social mobility
- peace
- economic growth

Which makes me think it is a self defeating blindness. When we choose to disregard a group of humans because they are different to us, we are elevating our needs above theirs. It is sad that this creates a chain of events where everbody suffers.
