Summary:

I travelled to California with my family over easter, primarily to attend a fmaily wedding. We had a great time and enjoyed the chance to relax with family.  We stayed with family for 6 days in San Diego, and after the wedding travelled for a week to LA, Joshua Tree and San Luis Obispo county.
