Tweet: This is a great example of repurposing an industrial space for the next stage of the industrial revolution - knowledge work. 
Summary: Shipping containers make surprisingly good offices

Recently I've moved into a new coworking space, sharing an office unit with
another entrepreuneur. What makes this coworking space unique is it's
conversion from an industrial bakery using shipping containers with glass
walls and door sections.

The skylights, glass walls and bright green paint make a great atmosphere, and
the space seems popular with designers and founders working in crative
industries. It's an energetic space with a creative feel to it.
