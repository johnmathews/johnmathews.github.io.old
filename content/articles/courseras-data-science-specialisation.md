Last year I decided to learn the tools required to work as a data
scientist. I was confident I already had the mathematical and analysis
skills I needed, but I wasn't familiar with the tools of the trade.

Some googling brought me to Coursera, and the [Data Science
Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
run by Johns Hopkins University.  It consists of 9 courses, and so far
I've completed five. If you do the courses in order then prior knowledge
isn't required, and I think the courses strike a good balance of brevity
and depth.

The main downside to me is that the courses exclusively use R (which is
popular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more
popular in Industry).  

Each course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data
science, such as statistical inference or machine learning. Key concepts
and tools in each subject are explained and developed, and whilst it's
not as thorough as a longer course would be, there is more than enough
material packed into the lectures, quizzes, assignments and projects to
apply to real applications.

I've read that the second half of the specialisation is a lot more
technical than the first, so I'm looking forward to setting aside some
time, working through the assignments and acquiring some useful skills!
