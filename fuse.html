	"body": "You can upload any image, I suggest googling dashcam traffic lights, or use one of the images below. Images should be smaller than 4mb and should be .jpeg, .bmp or .png. The Shortest Route To A\u00a0Demo This demonstration was inspired by the job description for a freelance role I recently applied for. The project involved recognising faults with traffic lights and I wanted to see how quickly I could develop an end-to-end computer vision system that recognises and labels traffic\u00a0lights. This is a relatively simple solution which prioritized speed, simplicity and low costs. I used the free tier of the Azure Custom Vision service to train and deploy the model. The model is trained to recognise and label traffic\u00a0lights. Summary The model is hosted on Azure Custom Vision on the free\u00a0tier The model is trained on ~4500\u00a0images Images are part of the DriveU Traffic Light\u00a0Dataset To improve the model I\u00a0would: Use many more\u00a0images Experiment with different model\u00a0architectures Tune the\u00a0hyper-parameters Method Find a good dataset. It would have taken too long to create my own labelled dataset so I needed to find a freely available set of labelled images. It turns out there are several to choose from. Waymo have a huge dataset that is freely available but I chose to use the DriveU Traffic Light dataset instead. It\u2019s well documented, easily accessible and good\u00a0enough. Convert the images - the DTLD images are 16-bit .TIFF images. I needed .JPEG or .PNG images. I first converted the 16-bit .TIFF images to 8-bit, and then converted them to .JPEG. The DTLD dataset contains more image data and metadata than I needed so I simply ignored or stripped out what I didn\u2019t\u00a0need. Parse the label data to extract only the information I needed. The DTLD dataset contains labels that specify the location of the traffic lights in the images as well as the type of traffic light and what phase the lights are in. I was only interested in the location of the lights for this demo. I needed to convert the coordinates of the regions from absolute to\u00a0relative. Create a Custom Vision project, create custom tags, and upload pairs of images and labels in the required form. The documentation was good enough and whilst there were a few steps that were\u00a0unclear. I was able to quickly figure out what to do, usually by clicking around to try a couple things and check the results. Each cloud platform has its own quirks and design concepts, and once you\u2019ve understood the pattern you can develop a good intuition for how each platform (in this case Azure) \u201cwants\u201d you to do\u00a0something. Train the model. There aren\u2019t many options to choose from and the dataset wasn\u2019t very\u00a0big. Use the model to make\u00a0predictions. Create a simple UI on a static site (this page) using JavaScript and HTML. The JavaScript Fetch API is used to query the Custom Vision API. jQuery and some custom (vanilla) JavaScript is used to parse the results and create the interactive elements on the\u00a0page. The model\u2019s results are shown by overlaying an HTML canvas element on top of the img element that shows the image that\u2019s been uploaded by the user. The regions and probabilities are drawn using HTML Canvas methods (strokeRect, fillText etc). Next\u00a0steps: The model is trained on images from German Cities. In order to generalise the model it should be trained using images from a wider distribution. This could\u00a0include: Rural and urban\u00a0settings. Views from footpaths as well as\u00a0roads. Different weather\u00a0conditions. Different cities and\u00a0countries. It would be nice to let the user adjust the minimum probability threshold. Currently only results with a probability above 10% are\u00a0shown. Test\u00a0images: You could use these images to test the model. You\u2019ll need to store them locally before\u00a0uploading.

			"date": "9 July 9999",
 "tags": "corporations, business, meta ",			"body": "I\u2019ve worked in 4 or 5 large organisations and culturally they are all very similar. This is to be expected I think because as the number of people in an organisation increases, the average personality type will trend towards the average population personality type. Every organisation hires from the same location independent pool of\u00a0talent. Another similarity is the amount of friction and distraction encountered when trying to get anything done. This might not be preventable and might not be serious enough to negate the benefits of hiring additional workers, but I\u2019m not\u00a0sure. For example, I\u2019ve been working at a new large organisation for 5 days now and have received 379 emails. That\u2019s 76 each day on average, or about 10 per hour. When I started my calendar looked almost completely full from all the invites. It wasn\u2019t clear which emails or events were important (I hadn\u2019t started my job yet) so I deleted everything. If any of it was important then I\u2019m assuming someone will notice. As an aside, I wouldn\u2019t do this if I was at the beginning of my career (I think I\u2019m approaching \u201cmid-career\u201d now), or if I was more excited about the idea of making new friends and meeting new people. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to meet people, but I\u2019m happy to focus on just work whilst I\u2019m working, and see my relationships there as transactional and only professional. I can put my social energies into my friendships outside of\u00a0work. I also wonder about the unspoken rules of workplaces, and the real motivations and desires of the people I work with. I know that I\u2019m unusual - most people haven\u2019t had the opportunities or the experiences that I\u2019ve had and have built upon. I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m working independently and building something difficult. I like environments with high uncertainty and high agency, high risk and high reward. Large organisations are not like this at all. These four qualities are all deliberately and strategically\u00a0neutered."

			"date": "6 July 2021",
 "tags": "history ",			"body": "We use historical events as examples to learn from, but is it possible to acquire a true understanding of a historical\u00a0event? The answer is important because we use that understanding to learn by example, and identify patterns of cause and effect. Is it possible for a normal person to do this, or does it require training, lots of time, or special skills? Is it impossible for\u00a0everyone? I started thinking about this when I had the following\u00a0thought: When we think we understand why something historical happened, all we\u2019ve probably done is accept a story that seems\u00a0plausible. Limitations and\u00a0Reliability An account of an event must necessarily be a simplification - not all details can be recorded or learned. This is ok because most details are not pertinent and have no meaningful\u00a0consequences. But how do we choose which details are included, and how do we verify that the details were chosen\u00a0correctly? How can we be sure that a lesson or conclusion based on historical events is\u00a0reliable? Hypothetical\u00a0model The truthfulness of a historical story could be thought of as a value on a scale ranging from completely false to perfectly true. I think that there are mechanisms that push popular or resilient narratives towards the middle of this scale and away from either\u00a0extreme. As a version of a story approaches the dishonest end it will contain an increasing number of errors or omit an increasing number of pertinent facts. This has the effect\u00a0of: Increasing the likelihood and frequency of someone hearing the story and rebutting its\u00a0assertions. Making it harder to align the assertions and implications with existing understandings of\u00a0reality. At the opposite end of the scale, a story is unlikely to be comprehensively honest\u00a0because: Adding truth requires adding complexity. It is easier to create or capture a simple story than a complicated\u00a0story. As a story\u2019s detail and depth increases so do the resources required to communicate it. Each narrative is competing for attention and a complex story requires more resources to broadcast and listen to than a simple story. Those with the resources to do so will want the story to benefit them in some\u00a0way. This creates incentives to omit inconvenient truths and\u00a0distractions. Implications I think that there is unfortunately no substitute for the hard work of coordinating disparate information, because the truthiness of a conclusion is generally proportional to the inconvenience of the effort spent forming\u00a0it. We are predisposed to choose convenience over inconvenience and this\u00a0enables: History to be written by the \u201cwinning side\u201d, who have more resources than the \u201closing\u00a0side\u201d. Complex events to be simplified into expedient and bite-sized\u00a0narratives. As time passes, the practical benefit of holding a view that differs from a popular narrative decreases. This reduces any incentive to challenge a popular\u00a0view. This creates a feedback loop that makes it increasingly difficult for a younger generation to discover information about historical events that challenge a popular\u00a0narrative. An\u00a0heuristic How much evidence did I collect myself, that wasn\u2019t brought to my attention by an algorithm or by someone\u00a0else? Awkward\u00a0questions Was WW2 a battle of the good against the bad, or the bad against the really bad, or something\u00a0else? Why did the Allies win WW2? Was the influence of government on social freedoms in America 100 years ago dissimilar to China\u00a0today? Racial and ethnic discrimination was normal 100 years ago - it appears to have been so universally accepted that I\u2019m led to question the presuppositions of modern attitudes about human nature and\u00a0morality."

It was quickly buried and didn\u2019t get any\u00a0attention. To my surprise, I received an email from a Hacker News administrator (Daniel) explaining that it was a good quality post and would be boosted to the front page at a random time within the next couple of\u00a0days. Sure enough, in the early hours of the next morning, the post was boosted. I woke up to various notifications that people had started following me on twitter, which never happens. After delegating the kid\u2019s breakfast duties, I logged into GCP to see what affect the extra traffic had on my experimental\u00a0tool. The Hacker News\u00a0affect Traffic had increased by about 30x and my hastily built tool was looking very sub-optimal. Two problems stood out - the aggregated analytics data was taking anywhere from 20 - 30 seconds to load (up from around a passable-ish 5 under normal conditions), and I was running up a bill of around\u00a0\u20ac10/day. Bad\u00a0news The reason for both of these problems was a shockingly inefficient and lazy approach to serving the\u00a0analytics. Each time the analytics page was loaded, a cloud function would fetch all the data in the DataStore database, munch all that data and return a freshly derived blob of JSON. Never mind that almost the exact same computation had occurred hundreds of times\u00a0already. As the amount of data in the DataStore increases, so does the time required to serve the analytics page. In the second chart below (dashboard for the get-analytics cloud function), it looks like the execution time increases at a rate of O(log\u00a0n). Good\u00a0news The good news though was that the page-view-logger function was handling the extra traffic smoothly. You can see in the dashboard image below (click on it) that almost every request was completed in less than 200ms, which I think is fine for a background process. I could also see the active instances scaling up and down well within its preset limits, as\u00a0expected. API traffic for the\u00a0tool Dashboard for the get-analytics cloud\u00a0function Dashboard for the page-view-logger function The\u00a0Solution I began to ponder the importance of all the things I didn\u2019t know about databases, and what DataStore might be good and bad at doing. Scrolling through the documentation I could see google boasting of super quick writes, but not super quick reads. I\u2019d already seen how many API calls were being made to the Cloud DataStore API and knew I\u2019d probably have to redesign part of the\u00a0tool. Idea 1: Use global\u00a0objects I attempted a few easy wins, mostly using the idea that if an instance of a function was invoked multiple times before being powered-down then global objects would still be available in\u00a0memory. If I put the data collected from the DataStore into a global object then I could check for its existence in subsequent function calls. This would save a lot of API calls and likely remove the largest bottleneck, saving my readers 10+ seconds of watching a loading\u00a0spinner. For whatever reason, this didn\u2019t work. Even if it had, the tool could still be vastly improved by taking a different approach that would be even faster and also reduce costs. I\u2019d like to have this tool running indefinitely so reducing daily costs to an absolute minimum is\u00a0important. Idea 2: Store the results themselves in the\u00a0database It was obviously inefficient to repeat the same calculations multiple times. A good long-term solution would require aggregating the data periodically and then fetching and serving these aggregated data to the\u00a0client. I tried putting the JSON into the DataStore using a different key, but ran into errors about the data for each entity being too large. Even if I split the aggregated data into multiple component parts it would still be too large, and would grow over time. I guess DataStore isn\u2019t meant to be used like\u00a0this. I probably could have pursued this idea a bit further, but I didn\u2019t want to change the structure of the JSON blob served to client. If I did change it then I\u2019d need to rewrite the client side JavaScript as\u00a0well. Client side work is faster than back-end, but writing JavaScript is fiddly compared to Python in my opinion. There\u2019s always multiple ways of doing a thing, and several versions of an API, so googling a solution isn\u2019t as simple as for\u00a0Python. Idea 3: Forget DataStore, use\u00a0buckets Final idea - store the results as a JSON blob in a Storage bucket and point the client at the bucket instead of the Cloud\u00a0Function. Turns out this is a super fast and efficient solution. /analytics.html now loads in less than half a second, and the only variable costs are egress on the bucket, which will be much smaller than the comparable costs of running a Cloud\u00a0Function. The computation expense of calculating the analytical results is fixed and decoupled from the number of page views using the following\u00a0method: Every few minutes Cloud Scheduler targets a Pub/Sub\u00a0topic. The topic triggers a Cloud\u00a0Function. The Cloud Function then: Queries the DataStore and collects the\u00a0data. Calculates the analytics\u00a0results. Generates a JSON blob containing the\u00a0results. Pushes the JSON to a storage bucket which is available to a\u00a0client. Further\u00a0improvement The aggregated results for days other than the current day are still needlessly recalculated - once midnight rolls around the results are clearly not going to keep on\u00a0changing. Instead of having one JSON blob containing data for all the last 30 days, I could have a blob for each day (or perhaps each week). This would reduce the amount of data extracted from the DataStore. This would reduce costs and computational\u00a0expense."

			"body": "Table of Contents A mystery Possible Reasons Comparison CloudFlare Analytics CloudFlare Web Analytics My own analytics tool A mystery CloudFlare give me two different measures of how many people have visited my website, one using their Analytics product and other from their new Web Analytics product. I get very different results for page views and number of visitors. I also get a third distinct set of results from my own analytics tool. Possible Reasons The reasons for this don\u2019t seem to be explained anywhere obvious, but I think it could be caused by ad blockers preventing the JavaScript used for the Web Analytics product. The normal, (not Web) Analytics product might derive its results from server side events, which would catch everything including bots and RSS clients, and be unaffected by ad blockers. Most of my visitors read the technical articles and therefore the audience is probably very technical and likely to be using an ad blocker. If this is the case then one way to test my hypothesis would be to write some articles that appeal to a non-technical audience who are less likely to use an ad blocker. In this case I would expect the two analytics methods to agree more closely. Comparison I made some screen shots at 11pm on June 29\\(^{th}\\) and compared the results from the CloudFlare Analytics, CloudFlare Web Analytics, and my own analytics tool. CloudFlare\u2019s (normal) analytics say I\u2019ve had 234 unique visitors. But their Web Analytics tool says I\u2019ve had 11 visitors. My own tool reports 12 unique visitors. Why are these results so different? Maybe one measure might be including bots and another might only be trying to report real people using normal browsers, but the difference seems too high for that.1 I\u2019d also expect real usage to fall when its night in the countries I get most traffic from, which I don\u2019t see. Perhaps the difference is caused by 95% of my readers are using an ad blocker. My own analytics tool can\u2019t give results from a rolling 24 hour window, it only groups data by day. Therefore I recorded the values at 11pm, which should be close enough. My simple method of logging IP addresses when a page is loaded and counting the unique IP addresses each day says that I\u2019ve had 12 unique users. Much closer to the CloudFlare analytics beta result, but I wouldn\u2019t expect my bespoke tool to be blocked by an Ad Blocker. If it were as simple as concluding that my own results agree with the CloudFlare analytics beta then that might be enough. But they only agree on this particular metric. I\u2019ve logged 47 page views today using my own tool but the CloudFlare Analytics beta reports only 11 page views2. Please let me know on twitter if you have any ideas!

			"category": "Non-technical/Journal",
			"url": "proverbs-16.html",
			"date": "25 June 2021",
 "tags": "books, bible, wisdom ",			"body": "The first 9 verses seem to loosely be about plans and the motivations for various actions. The wisdom and purpose of God\u2019s actions are contrasted with the motivations of human plans. The first proverb is a bit of a riddle. \\(^{1}\\)The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. I get the first part, but why would a spoken answer generally be from God? Is it that even if you are wise, and fear God, your plans are still your own but the way you speak about them is different because you fear God? \\(^{2}\\)All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirit. Don\u2019t be surprised that foolish, stupid or evil people think that their actions and decisions are upstanding and good. Understand that God says the spirit (motivation or attitude) that produced the plan or the actions is what should be judged. I don\u2019t think that God would agree that \u201cthe ends justifies the means\u201d. \\(^{3}\\)Commit your work to the Lord and your plans will be established. A good proverb for fridge magnets. \\(^{4}\\)The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble. The mysteries around moral responsibility from free will and predestination are not unique to the New Testament. I can\u2019t think of anything useful to say in order to expand on this. I believe it\u2019s true, I don\u2019t really know what I would do differently now that I\u2019ve read this proverb. I can trust God that he knows what he\u2019s doing and that he is good. I\u2019ll add it to my list of things I know about God without taking anything else off the list. \\(^{5}\\)Everyone who is arrogant1 in heart is an abomination to the Lord, be assured he will not go unpunished. God really doesn\u2019t like arrogance, which seems very similar to pride. This is troubling because society seems to have lost any appreciation for humility to the point where we no longer know how to talk about the virtues and vices of humility and pride. Pride is considered a virtue and is conflated with self-worth. We lack the nuance required to reliably discern wisdom from folly. \\(^{6}\\)By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the Lord one turns away from evil. It is refreshing and pleasant to read about Steadfast love and faithfulness. I don\u2019t hear many people talking about these virtues - love has been reduced or redefined as something that can be found or changed quickly. Faithfulness isn\u2019t celebrated or spoken about very much. Maybe because it isn\u2019t as dramatic as betrayal. Faithfulness and steadfast love are predicated on humility, which is another concept society seems silent about. The second half of the proverb is also profound. It tells me how I can turn away from evil. I know that it is easier to say I will change my ways than it is to actually change, consistently. \u201cBeing good\u201d or \u201cturning away from evil\u201d is not nearly as easy or simple as a child thinks it is, and this proverb tells me how to do it. The last proverb of the previous chapter said that the fear of the lord is instruction in wisdom, and that humility comes before honor. \\(^{8}\\)Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice. In case there was any doubt, here it is. Don\u2019t compromise yourself in order to make more money. \\(^{9}\\)The heart of a man plans his way, but the Lord establishes2 his steps. So I can make my own plans, but if my plans are to be successful, or substantial, I need the Lord to make my plans \u201cfirm\u201d or \u201cpermanent\u201d. \\(^{10}\\)An oracle is on the lips of a king, his mouth does not sin in judgement. I don\u2019t know what this means. An oracle is \u201ca priest acting as a medium through whom advice or prophecy was sought from the gods.\u201d Kings have certainly sinned when making judgements. \\(^{11}\\)A just balance and scales are the Lords, all the weights in the bag are his work. God loves justice, and the instruments or justice are ultimately his, and are from him. \\(^{12}\\)It is an abomination to kings to do evil, for the throne is established by righteousness. The kings in verses 12 and 10 are not like kings I have heard about. If 12 is true then perhaps 10 can be true. At a minimum, 12 and 13 provides some standard by which to judge kings. \\(^{16}\\)How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. One of the many bits of advice that could come from this would be to prioritise jobs with training and experience over jobs with higher salaries immediately. Especially in your twenties or when you are starting your career. You don\u2019t need lots of disposable income, you do need wisdom, training, experience, perspective, time with wise or experienced people. \\(^{17}\\)The highway of the upright turns aside from evil, whoever guards his way preserves his life. Guarding your way - this is not a concept or expression I\u2019ve heard of before. I guess it could mean \u201cdefend the path your life could take\u201d, or \u201cthink about the consequences (second order consequences).\u201d \\(^{18}\\)Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. God really doesn\u2019t like pride, and also it leads to destruction. This is not a coincidence. Haughty means \u201carrogantly superior or disdainful\u201d which is mostly a synonym for prideful. \\(^{19}\\)It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud. Avoid prideful people, avoid evil people. Proverbs seems really clear that you are supposed to socialise and spend time with people you want to be like. A lowly spirit is \u201clow is status, or humble\u201d. Better to hang out with poor people and be humble than to be rich and associate with prideful people. \\(^{20}\\)Whoever gives thought to a matter will discover good, and blessed is he who trusts in the Lord. More encouragement to trust God, and to be considerate. 21 and 23 both say that it is wise to speak persuasively or encouragingly. If the words are well intended, then make them more effective by being persuasive. \\(^{21}\\)The wise of heart is called discerning, and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness. \\(^{23}\\)The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious3 and adds persuasiveness to his lips. \\(^{24}\\)Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.Our words affect our bodies, and our souls. Gracious words are really valuable. Gracious means to be kind, courteous, or patient. Let it go, be gentle. \\(^{25}\\)There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. Don\u2019t be so confident in your own wisdom and judgement. It\u2019s not just that your judgement is a bit less good than God\u2019s, this proverb says its totally opposite. Expect to be doing things that look like the opposite of what someone might expect. Expect to do unintuitive things. \\(^{26}\\)A workers appetite works for him, his mouth urges him on. True that. \\(^{32}\\)Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city. Wow. This is high praise for self control. if (!document.getElementById(\u0027mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#\u0027)) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width Arrogant: Having or revealing an exaggerated sense of ones own importance or abilities. \u21a9Establish: Set up on a firm or permanent basis. \u21a9Judicious: Having, showing or done with good judgement or sense. \u21a9"

 "tags": "books, bible, wisdom ",			"body": "\\(^{1}\\)A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. A soft answer can diffuse a volatile situation, and speaking harshly leads to anger. \\(^{2}\\)The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouths of fools poor out folly. Knowledge is to be commended. If someone speaks a lot of folly, they are a fool. Folly is \u201cfoolishness or a lack of good sense\u201d - it\u2019ll take discernment to judge a lack of good sense. Find someone who commends acquiring knowledge, and learning. \\(^{3}\\)The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good. Don\u2019t mistake God\u2019s patience for indifference, know that your good works and faithfulness are seen. \\(^{4}\\)A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit. Yet again, this book teaches that our words are powerful and have great consequence. A gentle tongue, a soft answer, guarded words preserver life, good fruit, fountain of life, now a tree of life. It is unequivocal, as is the inverse. \\(^{5}\\)A fool despises his father\u2019s instruction but whoever heeds reproof is prudent. I just had a thought that people younger than 10 would have a difficult time heeding or despising, and are too young to be considered wise or foolish. They are children. When proverbs refers to parents and children, I reckon its probably referring to either adult children and maybe teenagers. I have young kids so I\u2019m predisposed to see parenting advice in that context. \\(^{7}\\)The lips of the wise spread knowledge, not so the hearts of fools. What you say is important.. \\(^{8}\\)The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayers of the upright are acceptable to him. Integrity matters, and it seems that God is more concerned with motivation than impact. Better to pray quietly and honestly than to hypocritically do good works in public. \\(^{11}\\)Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord, how much more the hearts of the children of man! I am guessing that Sheol and Abaddon are some reference to a hellish place - if God can perceive what happens in a completely godless place that is far from him, it is going to be trivial to perceive the thoughts and motivations of your heart. He can read us like an open book. \\(^{12}\\)A scoffer does not like to be reproved, he will not go to the wise. Reproof is almost as strong of a theme as words. Reproof is part of growing up and becoming wise. You must be reproved if you are to learn and become wise. If I do not reprove my children then I am negligent. If you want to avoid reproof or do not accept it then you are a fool. But remember, these are proverbs - they are generally true, most of the time. There will be situations where you parent gives bad advice and you\u2019d be wise to ignore it. But its the exception, not the rule. If everyone else is the problem, then the problem is certainly you. \\(^{13}\\)A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but by sorrow the spirit is crushed. This proverb connections emotions, spirit and the physical body. It says they are linked. If you are happy then you will look happy, and vice versa. If you carry around stress and tension then it\u2019s going to change how you look. Don\u2019t be sad indefinitely, it will crush you. Grieve, and grow, and move on. \\(^{14}\\)The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the mouths of fools feed on folly. This isn\u2019t talking about the consequences of your words, it says that if you have understanding then your heart will desire knowledge. If you feed on folly, which is like consuming things that are foolish, then you are a fool. \\(^{15}\\)All the days of the afflicted are evil, but the cheerful of heart has a continual feast. A pessimist and an optimist could experience the same event and become respectively more pessimistic and more optimistic. As much as you are able, choose to have a cheerful heart. If you are afflicted, then don\u2019t give up hope. Affliction doesn\u2019t mean you did something wrong or lack wisdom. \\(^{16}\\)Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and trouble with it. So the fear of the Lord leads to the avoidance of trouble.. and it is better to live peaceably than deal with trouble. \\(^{17}\\)Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and hatred with it. Better to eat only garnishes, or bait, with people who love you than fine dining with people who do not. \\(^{18}\\)A hot-tempered man stirs up strife but he who is slow to anger quiets contention. Don\u2019t lose your temper. Blessed are the peace-makers.. \\(^{22}\\)Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed. You\u2019re not supposed to know everything and be completely independent. You are supposed to ask for help, weigh the advice, and deliberately look for wise people to be friends with. \\(^{23}\\)To make an apt1 answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it is! It is fun to say something apt? It is a blessing to receive a bit of well-timed advice. Proverbs talks a lot about words and mouths. For most of history, books have been rare and literacy was not widespread. Therefore most knowledge transfer would occur by speaking. Maybe it still does today because it feels like it requires less effort than reading. I think the same principles can be applied to reading and writing as for hearing and speaking. \\(^{25}\\)The Lord tears down the house of the proud but maintains the widow\u2019s boundaries. The boundaries are the edges of the land owned by the widow. God really doesn\u2019t like proud people, and is soft-hearted towards the vulnerable. \\(^{27}\\)He who is greedy for unjust gain troubles his own household, but he who hates bribes will live. Don\u2019t be a fool, don\u2019t be bribed - directly or indirectly. Love life, look after your family, and hate bribes. Loving one thing means you hate other things. If you\u2019re building a business, design for Segregation of Duties. \\(^{28}\\)The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things. It is good, and Godly, to think about your answer before you say it. \\(^{33}\\)The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom, and humility comes before honor. Ok great - I have a definition for what \u201cfear of the Lord\u201d means. (And it\u2019s a reliable definition too.) I still don\u2019t understand why this is what it means, but at least I know what it means. They why question is less foundational that the what. Learn humility, despise pride. Seek wisdom. if (!document.getElementById(\u0027mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#\u0027)) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width Apt: Appropriate or suitable in the circumstances. \u21a9"

			"category": "Technical/Web",
			"url": "building-my-own-site-analytics.html",
			"date": "22 June 2021",
 "tags": "cloud-functions, data ",			"body": "I\u2019ve built a simple client-side website analytics tool for this site, you can see it at /analytics. It has the following metrics: Page views per day, Unique IP addresses per day Views per page per day. This article eventually made it to the front page of Hacker News, which resulted in a lot of extra traffic and an opportunity to see how the tool performed under a much heavier load. I wrote about the affects of this and subsequent design changes here. I compare the different results from CloudFlare Analytics, CloudFlare Web Analytics and my own tool in this follow-up article. Motivation Google Analytics Google Analytics felt like overkill. It has so many data-points that the useful metrics are obscured. I also like this site to load quickly and GA makes it slower. CloudFlare Analytics I\u2019ve also tried CloudFlare Analytics. It\u2019s a lot simpler than GA and better suits my use case, but I don\u2019t think its accurate. Design Considerations The analytics should be easy to access and easy to understand1. I know from my work visualizing data and building dashboards that the metrics presented will alter the users perception of the underlying reality. The way that someone thinks about their impact on a business, the value they\u2019ve produced, or the dynamics of the underlying system (a product\u2019s quality, site performance, growth, etc) is influenced by the design decisions I make, such as which metrics are available, how easy they are to access, or which metrics are above the fold. If I present a particular metric as if its important, it will be difficult for someone who uses the dashboard to resist this implied message. They\u2019ll eventually consider the metric as a Key Indicator of some kind. For these reasons I wanted to see only the most important metrics about my website, and I wanted to see them in a simple way without distraction. The only metrics I\u2019m interested in are: How many people are reading my site What are they reading How much are they reading. I\u2019d like to be able to infer whether I have a few people who read a lot, or a lot of people who read a little. (Or, as is the case, a few people who read a little.) Method Motivation The main reason for making my own analytics tool it because its a fun challenge with an obvious and useful result. Building it required connecting a few technologies - Serverless Computing (Cloud Functions on GCP), NoSQL databases (DataStore), JavaScript, HTTP headers. Assumptions I\u2019m assuming that unique IP addresses is a good enough proxy for unique readers, even though I\u2019m not considering crawlers, bots, or RSS subscribers2 . Technique The analytics \u201cengine\u201d works by consuming a request that is sent by the client each time a page is loaded. The request is parsed by a Cloud Function on GCP which extracts the page URL and the IP address. This is then recorded in a DataStore database along with the current date and time. Viewing the analytics is as simple (and as complicated) as making a request to the database, parsing the data and visualizing it conveniently. For example, group the data by days and count the distinct IP Addresses to figure out how many people are visiting each day. This is achieved by making a request to another Cloud Function that returns a response with a JSON payload. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, there are edge cases I\u2019m not considering. I expect it to be mostly right and good enough for my purposes. It didn\u2019t take much effort and it was a fun mini project. The hardest part was figuring out chart.js, the slowest part was iterating on the Cloud Functions. Mocking Cloud Functions I haven\u2019t figured out how to easily test cloud functions locally - it would require setting up a NoSQL database and mocking Flask requests and responses. Instead of doing that, I watched Peaky Blinders for a couple of minutes whilst each new version of the Cloud Function was deploying. Improvements Eventually I\u2019ll want to group the metrics by week or month I expect. It\u2019ll be a good way of learning and playing with cloud technologies and JavaScript. Unless someone decides to spam the site, I expect the costs to be less than \u20ac1/month. This site is hosted using CloudFlare, so I suppose I could setup some page rules to prevent malicious traffic3 . Tasks for later Make /analytics.html load faster - latency is caused by the Cloud Function initialising. Short of paying actual money for always-on resources I can\u2019t see a way to reduce this. However it\u2019s only an issue if you are the first person to view the page in the last ~10 minutes - this blog post explains whj. Add loading spinners - I used the same snippets as in my Machine Vision demo. Group data by weeks or months as well as day. Identify bots and search engines - the analytics requires JavaScript to be running so I think some types of non-human activity is already filtered. How can I do this? Aggregate the data (once per day) in a Cloud Function instead of repeatedly in the browser. Understand why the DataStore API is called multiple times for a single fetch. Questions I\u2019d be interested to know if there is a way to track RSS subscribers. I know that the usual method is to inspect server logs, but this site is hosted on GitHub pages so I don\u2019t think this is possible. To what extent does requiring JavaScript in order to log a page view filter out bots and crawlers? I\u2019ve used the chart.js library because its reasonably fast and lightweight. My preferred library would be Plotly if it could be responsive and fast even if there are \u003e10 charts to render. Has plotly.js improved recently to the point where it wouldn\u2019t cause a browser to lag if multiple plots are being rendered? Finally, it occurs to me that I could make an analytics widget for my desktop using \u00dcbersicht. It could show page views for the current day perhaps. I\u2019ve made a couple of widgets before [1, 2] which were written in CoffeeScript, but the newer widgets are written in React, so I guess this is an opportunity to learn4 . Writing the \u201cTime Since\u201d (my daughters birth) and \u201cTime Until\u201d (my next accounting exam5 ) widgets were my first ever taste of CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The first ever article on this blog was about the \u201cTime Since\u201d widget. CoffeeScript, and Ubersicht were just about simple enough for me to learn by trial and error, copying someone else\u2019s code and changing it bit by bit until I had what I want. Site AnalyticsIn Google Analytics it can be fun clicking around on all the things and seeing lots of options, but its not really useful once the novelty has worn off. \u21a9I think this might be quite wrong, but I don\u2019t know why. \u21a9The page is now rate limited to 5 requests per minute per IP address. \u21a9Done! My desktop now looks like this: \u21a9I failed the exam because I\u2019d been working on Ry\u2019s Git Tutorial instead. \u21a9"

It\u2019s important that I remember that wisdom - the desirable quality that so much of proverbs is about - is personified as a woman, like in chapter 9:1, Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn1 her seven pillars. \\(^{2}\\)Whoever walks in uprightness fears the Lord, but he who is devious in his ways despises him. Fear is contrasted with despising, so I don\u2019t think this is supposed to fear of violence or victimisation, but more like a feeling of reverence and profound respect. The Lord loves me, and in the previous chapter it says that parents discipline their children. \\(^{4}\\)Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean, but abundant crops come by the strength of the ox. This is really interesting, the point feels modern. The rural imagery is unusual (to me) but otherwise it feels like something you might find on Instagram. What\u2019s the lesson? Progress is messy, or doing work creates waste, don\u2019t fret about the cleanliness of your manger if you want to have a productive farm.. \\(^{5}\\)A faithful witness does not lie, but a false witness breathes out lies. It\u2019s really important - don\u2019t lie. This is a strong recurring message. \\(^{6}\\)A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain, but knowledge is easy for a man of understanding. What does he understand? That scoffing is harmful to the scoffer, and what else? \\(^{7}\\)Leave the presence of a fool, for there you do not meet words of knowledge. It would be good to have a clearer understanding of the differences between understanding and knowledge. This proverb is very similar to modern sayings like \u201cYou become like the 5 people you spend most time with\u201d. What are the marks of a fool? How do you know if you\u2019re hanging out with a foolish person? They talk a lot, without thinking about their words. They are quick to become angry or emotional. They are not diligent, or consistently hard working. They don\u2019t plan ahead (filling their barns in summer). \\(^{8}\\)The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way, but the folly of fools is deceiving. It\u2019s wise, and prudent, to discern a course of action, or series of events and decisions. Discern means \u201crecognise or find out\u201d, I tend to use it to \u201clook closely for additional clues about what might happen\u201d. \u201cPrudent\u201d means to \u201cact or demonstrate care and thought for the future\u201d. \\(^{10}\\)The heart knows its own bitterness, and no stranger shares its joy. This, I think, makes total sense to an old person and seems mysterious to young people. When I first read it I thought it said something like \u201cno-one shares its joy\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t. Only \u201cstranger\u201d. Family and close friends can share joy, but they still won\u2019t be able to know your bitterness. I\u2019d recommend not holding onto bitterness, and finding out how its possible to forgive because of the work that Jesus completed. \\(^{11}\\)The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish. Again, don\u2019t be wicked, it will go badly for you. If you are upright and living in a humble, fragile, vulnerable tent you can still flourish. \\(^{12}\\)There is a way that seems right to a man, but it\u2019s end is the way to death.This book doesn\u2019t pull any punches. It\u2019s an alarming assertion that someone can think they are doing things \u201cright\u201d but are in fact heading towards death. Don\u2019t rely on your own understanding, figure out what God thinks about a thing. \\(^{13}\\)Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be grief.At the moment I don\u2019t have much experience of grief, but I inevitably will. I know there is sorrow so profound that it becomes physical as well as emotional, and regret that changes what it means to be alive. I guess one of the things this proverb reveals is that its ok to laugh whilst experiencing heart ache, and its natural to feel happy and sad (laughing and heart-aching) at the same time. It\u2019s part of being alive emotionally, and shouldn\u2019t be considered weird or broken. 14 and 15 reiterate themes I\u2019ve noted previously. \\(^{16}\\)One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is reckless and careless. It is wise to not do something, even if you could. You don\u2019t have to do/see/visit all the things, even if you could. It\u2019s ok to risk erring on the side of cautious, because if you are not cautious, you are foolish. I guess that if you are discerning then you can perceive more clearly and what was originally partially known and therefore risky becomes less risky because there are fewer unknowns. Instead of \u201cmaybe its wrong\u201d it can become \u201cits almost definitely wrong, or right\u201d \\(^{17}\\)A man of quick temper acts foolishly, and a man of evil devices is hated. Don\u2019t lose your temper quickly. Losing it slowly is often more difficult. \\(^{18}\\)The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. You\u2019re supposed to aspire to prudence (and more generally, wisdom). You can\u2019t really opt out of this, because if you\u2019re not wise then you\u2019re a fool. If you\u2019re not prudent, you are (too) simple. And bad things happen to fools. \\(^{19}\\)The evil bow down before the good, the wicked at the gates of the righteous. It\u2019s surprising to read such bold and simple confidence that justice would prevail. No ifs or maybes or conditions, just a simple resolution at the end. \\(^{20}\\)The poor is disliked even by his neighbour, but the rich has many friends. Timeless pragmatism. This proverb is an observation, not a commendation. And look at the next proverb. \\(^{21}\\)Whoever despises his neighbour is a sinner, but the blessed is he who is generous to the poor.. Be generous, not just theoretically or in your thoughts, but also in your actions and your money (see 23). Don\u2019t despise people. Who is your neighbour? \\(^{22}\\)\u2026Those who devise good meet steadfast love and faithfulness. Steadfast love and faithfulness. \\(^{23}\\)In all toil there is profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty. It\u2019s not enough to only talk about loving your neighbour. And don\u2019t be convinced that any hard work you do it totally wasted, apparently it is not. \\(^{24}\\)The crown of the wise is their wealth, but the folly of fools brings folly. Really? Does wealth here mean something more or different to financial wealth? (I think I asked this in a previous proverb.) Not all wise people are rich, this is certain. And many biblical heroes were financially impoverished. Is it just a wide generalization? \\(^{25}\\)A truthful witness saves lives.. Literally. Though probably without knowing exactly which lives, and at what moment. Investors refer to this as second order consequences. \\(^{26}\\)In the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence, and his children will have refuge. The best that I can understand this is to read it the same as if it said \u201cIn the Lord one has strong confidence..\u201d. What does this proverb mean that my shortened simplified version doesn\u2019t? \\(^{27}\\)The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death. Turning away is like physically repenting. A fountain of life is a source of life, and probably health and healing. It is contrasted with death traps. It would be interesting to consider the relative importance of feelings and actions in this book. Is it that feelings lead to actions, but actions are what makes the difference - the judgement between wisdom and foolishness, love and hatred, depends (only) on your actions? \\(^{28}\\)In a multitude of people is the glory of a king, but without people a prince is ruined.If a king doesn\u2019t have any subjects, what is he king of? If leaders are not followed by any people, they cannot claim to be leaders. \\(^{29}\\)Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly.If you have a quick temper then you are responsible for it, and you are endorsing foolishness. Being slow to anger is a sign of wisdom. \\(^{30}\\)A tranquil heart gives life to the flesh, but envy makes the bones rot. Envy is apparently really bad. Tranquility is freedom from disturbance, or being calm. It\u2019s good for your health. \\(^{31}\\)Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him. The poor mater, and have dignity, and are worthy of respect, because we are all made. if (!document.getElementById(\u0027mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#\u0027)) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width Hewn: chop or cut with an const \u21a9"

 "tags": "books, bible, proverbs, wisdom ",			"body": "\\(^{1}\\)A wise son hears his father\u2019s instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. The chapter opens the same way as the previous chapter - with a proverb about the importance of wisdom, knowledge or instruction. As always, the proverb starts with the good example and then contrasts against it. \\(^{2}\\)From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good, but the desire of the treacherous is violence. Slightly weird imagery I think, my mouth produces fruit that I can then eat.. Weird. But I can see the principle - the fruit of my mouth is the words I speak, words are powerful for either good or evil. Speaking well will lead to good things that do what good food does - nourish, strengthen, sustain. Treacherous people desire violence. So are people who want to do violent things likely to betray? Maybe. \\(^{3}\\)He who guards his mouth preserves his life, he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. Choose your words carefully. \\(^{5}\\)The righteous hates falsehood, but the wicked brings shame and disgrace. It\u2019s OK to be strongly opposed to be falsehoods - misrepresentations, lies, manipulation, duplicity. \\(^{6}\\)Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless, but sin overthrows the wicked. I guess there are (at least) 2 ways of looking at this - the only way I can be blameless is by Jesus\u2019 imputed righteousness, which also saves me literally from death. The alternative is that I am not righteous and am overcome by sin. Alternatively and more prosaically, try to be blameless instead of wicked, and instead of creating trouble for yourself you\u2019ll find people bear with you for longer and are nicer to you. \\(^{7}\\) One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing. Another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. (I prefer not to use semicolons) I really like this proverb! The last 20 years have seen several degrees of financial wealth or lack, and the reality has often been very different to what I\u2019d expected. I often intuit that things must get easier, or nicer, or more fulfilling if only a certain problem was removed, or a certain something was bought, or recognised, or achieved. The reality is a lot more complicated than that. Wealth isn\u2019t what I thought it was, I thought it was mostly financial. Now, I think its freedom. Freedom to be at peace, to be unburdened of my past and present, freedom to still have hope for the future, freedom to have some spare time, freedom to not be crushed by life and be a good dad and husband and friend. \\(^{8}\\)The ransom of a man\u2019s life is his wealth, but a poor man hears no threat. oh! Incisive! This reminds me of \u201cno one ever really owns a fortune, it always seems to own them\u201d. There are various troubles and burdens you avoid by being poor, like choosing life instead of material excess. Lose your wealth and choose a rich life. \\(^{10}\\)By insolence1 comes nothing but strife, but with those who take advice is wisdom. Disrespect and rudeness never works, wisdom is acquired when you make a habit of asking for advice. \\(^{11}\\)Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it. I\u2019m surprised to read this - I didn\u2019t realise that the rate of change of ones wealth would likely effect how it can be sustained, and I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that this is some general principle that exists across millennia, cultures and geographies. \\(^{12}\\)Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life. This one I\u2019ve heard before. I don\u2019t really understand it, though. I\u2019m not sure what a sick heart definitely is. It seems counter-intuitive because we are told to keep on looking forward to and hoping for Jesus to complete his work saving us and bringing history to completion. There is a lot of \u201cnow and not yet\u201d tensions in between the time of Jesus\u2019 resurrection and second coming (I know so little about it that I don\u2019t particularly want to mention it). So maybe a Christian\u2019s heart would be expected to be a little sick? Also, if a desire fulfilled is a tree of life then I guess I\u2019m desiring the wrong kind of things - most of my desires are chasing after the wind. I desire to eat and then I get hungry again, desire to graduate and then realise the work hasn\u2019t even begun, etc. The image of a Tree of life hasn\u2019t been used before I don\u2019t think, maybe it means something specific which I\u2019m unaware of. There was a tree of life in the garden of Eden\u2026 13 - 16: Don\u2019t ignore wisdom, don\u2019t be an idiot, be prudent, have good sense. Strong recurring themes. \\(^{16}\\)Every prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly is interesting though - I think prudence is being used in a slightly different sense to what I\u2019m used to. This proverb is saying that one should be informed before acting. And because a fool rushes into action, it will be clear that the don\u2019t know what they are doing or talking about. \\(^{22}\\) A good man lays up an inheritance for his children\u2019s children, but the sinner\u2019s wealth is laid up for the righteous. I remember reading this when I was about 18 and thinking this was quite a burden - to leave an inheritance for grandchildren as well as children. Seventeen years later it makes a lot of sense - the inheritance isn\u2019t primarily money, but wisdom, peace, security. The way that I parent my children will directly effect how they parent their own children, and in this way I will either bless or curse my grandchildren. If I damage my children, they will suffer and be less able to provide for their own children (emotionally, physically, spiritually). Our own childhoods have a large influence on our adulthoods, and our ability to parent, so I should make sure my children have good childhoods, which is not a trivial endeavour. 23 and 24 break the pattern of \u201cgood example, bad example.\u201d \\(^{23}\\) The fallow2 ground of the poor would yield much food, but it is swept away through injustice. The missed opportunities are real. Poor people are not incapable of productive and fruitful work. It is injustice that prevents fruitfulness. I find this proverb subtly provocative and insightful. \\(^{24}\\) Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him. Parents who love their children do not enjoy causing them stress or discomfort, but if they love them and are wise then they discipline diligently, or consistently. Apparently physical punishment is timeless? \\(^{25}\\) The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want. The last proverb in the chapter finishes with encouragement that it is better to be righteous than wicked, because it leads to satisfaction rather than want. The previous chapter also finished with encouragement specifically about righteousness. Even though the book doesn\u2019t have headings it seems like it does have structure, and the author requires you to actually read the text closely in order to pull out meaning. Shocking. Clearly not optimised for engagement, SEO or social media. if (!document.getElementById(\u0027mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#\u0027)) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width Insolence: rude and disrespectful behaviour\u201d \u21a9Fallow: ploughed and harrowed but left for a period without being sown in order to restore its fertility or to avoid surplus production \u21a9"

			"category": "Non-technical/Journal",

			"date": "2 June 2021",
 "tags": "bible, proverbs, wisdom ",			"body": "The chapter starts with \u201cWhoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.\u201d and ends with \u201cIn the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death.\u201d The opening proverb is jarring to read, maybe because unlike \u201cwickedness\u201d or \u201crighteousness\u201d, which are concepts I don\u2019t hear or think much about day-to-day, \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d are very familiar and part of contemporary conversation. So is stupidity. So this proverb feels\u00a0tangible. What does it mean? If I love discipline then I am loving knowledge, and in this case I\u2019m confident the opposite is also true - If I avoid or dislike discipline then I avoid or dislike knowledge. Discipline is hard, I guess I need to lean into being disciplined, and remember\u00a0why. Encouragingly, the proverb is immediately followed by the reminder that \u201cA good man obtains favour from the Lord, but a man of evil devices he condemns\u201d, so make an effort, do good things, and obtain favour. That\u2019s a big reason to persevere through\u00a0discipline. \\(^4\\)\u201cAn excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.\u201d If it were me I\u2019d leave off all the negative second parts of these proverbs, its abrasive. But also if it were me I doubt they\u2019d be worth\u00a0studying. Why is the pattern of all these proverbs \u201cgood thing, bad thing\u201d - to make the contrast stronger? To know why to do a thing and also why not to do the opposite? To make it more punchy? I guess if its abrasive you are more likely to remember it, and if you\u2019re confident that what you are saying is true then you want it to be\u00a0remembered. Back to the proverb, this is a great proverb - I like it. It honors wives, though it does put them in the context of their husbands, and it also speaks to how valuable and precious a good wife is - crowns are precious and\u00a0rare. Empirically, it also feels thruthy - marriages are difficult and if either spouse can be considered \u201cexcellent\u201d then that is unusual and valuable. Relationships can give a lot of life and health and happiness, and require a lot of effort and work. To be an excellent spouse is certainly worth desiring and celebrating and\u00a0protecting. The next few verses contrast wickedness and righteousness - don\u2019t be wicked, be\u00a0upright! \\(^9\\) \u201cBetter to be lowly and have a servant that to play the great man and lack bread\u201d. Don\u2019t put appearances before substance? Don\u2019t spend money on fancy cars or clothes if you wont have enough for decent food? Prioritize substance (truth?) over appearances and social pressures? Having a servant (or a domestic helper) would certainly be helpful, and of more tangible benefit than receiving shout-outs at networking\u00a0events. \\(^{10}\\) \u201cWhoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.\u201d - animal welfare is\u00a0important. \\(^{11}\\) Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense. 11 and 12 are both about enjoying the good consequences of honest work, 11 advises against worthless pursuits, and 12 says that is a wicked to covet the profits of\u00a0evildoers. Verses 13 - 19 are all about speaking and listening. Each proverb contrasts good and evil or wisdom and\u00a0foolishness. 13 - your own dishonest words will become a trap for\u00a0you. 14 - you words and your works will come back to you - invest in them and dividends will be\u00a0returned. 17, 18 - these contrast each other. Your words are powerful, speaking the truth is honest (even when it isn\u2019t simple, or if it makes a situation more complicated) and being rash (acting without careful consideration of the consequences) can be as violent as wielding a sword. Wise words bring healing,\u00a0though. \\(^{15}\\) Fools think they are right, and because of the contrasting pattern presumably do not listen to (or ask for) advice. This seems similar to the Dunning-Kruger Effect Wise people know that they don\u2019t know everything they need to, ask for advice, and listen to\u00a0it. \\(^{16}\\) I had to look up Vexation - it means \u201cthe state of being annoyed, frustrated or worried\u201d. Wise people can stay calm and ignore insults. If you get all fired up when someone insults you you\u2019re probably (generally speaking) being\u00a0foolish. \\(^{19}\\) Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment. Truth endures, lies do\u00a0not. Verses 20 - 29 have two themes - the benefits of consistent hard work, and the benefits of being truthful. As usual, each proverb is a comparison of right and wrong or wisdom and\u00a0foolishness: \\(^{21}\\) No ill befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble. This is encouraging to read, and also highlights that proverbs highlight truthful patterns, but are not specific guarantees. - Obviously righteous people will have trouble, this proverb isn\u2019t saying that life will be perfectly pleasant. As usual, it is a push towards doing good because of the benefits, a pull away from doing wrong because of the\u00a0damage. \\(^{22}\\) .. those who act faithfully are his delight. It is wonderful to read that (a good) God would delight in\u00a0people. \\(^{23}\\) A prudent man conceals knowledge, but the heart of a fool proclaims knowledge. I find it surprising to read that concealing knowledge can be a desirable trait. I guess there are certain questions that must be answered before the answers to other questions can be understood, and I know that for my young children I wouldn\u2019t answer particular questions that same as if they were\u00a0adults. \\(^{24}\\) The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor. Its ironic, and counter-intuitive, that those who are diligent and able and willing to labor end up in management or leadership positions, and that those who would avoid laborious work end up doing\u00a0it. \\(^{25}\\) Anxiety in a man\u2019s heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad. I find it encouraging (again) to read that being weighed down by anxiety is normal, and I like that anxiety isn\u2019t described as a weakness or as foolishness. (I don\u2019t want to conjecture too much about what isn\u2019t written, but there\u2019s a long list of things that fools do and the consequences of foolishness, and anxiety isn\u2019t on the list.) This proverb also emphasises and encourages the impact of good\u00a0words. \\(^{28}\\) In the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death. How wonderful to know how to find life and avoid death. It\u2019s such a pleasing way to end a\u00a0chapter. if (!document.getElementById(\u0027mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#\u0027)) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width"

			"category": "Non-technical/Journal",
			"url": "proverbs-chapter-11.html",
			"date": "1 June 2021",
 "tags": "books, bible, proverbs, wisdom ",			"body": "Table of Contents Context Notes Examples Conclusion Context These are my notes from reading Proverbs, one of the books in the bible. Almost the entire book is a collection of proverbs - short sayings that are generally true. I presume there is some structure and themes in their arrangement, taking notes should help these become clearer and hopefully also help me remember and apply them\u00a0better. The book is split up into chapters, which are quite short sections of the book. It would probably take about a minute or two to read each one. The chapters are further split up into verses. In Proverbs each verse seems to be one\u00a0sentence. Numbering the text like this is useful because it lets you refer precisely to a part of the book. Proverbs does have a few headings, but they are too far apart to provide enough structure on their own, I\u00a0think. I\u2019ve read this book a couple of times before, and appreciated it even when I could feel that I was missing most of the wisdom in it. The book is quite easy to read - the sentences are short and the analogies seem simple\u00a0enough. It\u2019s refreshing to read something that has existed for thousands of year, has withstood criticisms, and feels approachable. It\u2019s practical, despite being old and written in a completely different cultural context. I find this\u00a0comforting. Notes Each proverb contrasts justice and injustice using a variety of phrases and images. Pride and humility, integrity and crookedness, righteousness and\u00a0wickedness. In the context of these qualities, various situations are described: a false balance, disgrace, wisdom,\u00a0riches. The proverbs are somewhat exaggerated, which seems reasonable given that they are self contained single sentences tasked with defining and then resolving a problem. The imagery is clear, it does not rely on\u00a0subtlety. The biggest themes are that honesty, integrity, righteousness are to be valued, and their opposites are to be avoided at all costs. Each of these qualities are in fact actions, not sentiments, and the consequences of these actions are reliable and consistent, and inevitable. The advice to \u201clove your neighbor like yourself\u201d is a good summary of many of the\u00a0proverbs. Its clarity and confidence is encouraging. Do good and good things will happen, do evil and the consequences are inevitably bad for\u00a0you. Examples The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is wise - the first part sounds wonderful. Who wouldn\u2019t want to produce life? The second part is surprising. What is the \u201ccapturing\u00a0souls\u201d? The desire of the righteous ends only in good, the expectation of the wicked in wrath. - this is\u00a0encouraging One gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want. - counter-intuitive Like a gold ring a pig\u2019s snout is a beautiful woman without discretion - this doesn\u2019t seem to fit in with any proverbs around it. Is this the only mention of a woman in this section? Why is it important enough to be included? Does this imply that beauty is discreet? There is surely a big cultural gap between Amsterdam in 2021 and where ever this was first\u00a0written. A man who is kind benefits himself, but a cruel man hurts himself. - this is good to\u00a0know Conclusion Don\u2019t lie, cheat, steal or plot. Treat people like you yourself would want to be\u00a0treated. Make an effort to do good and increase justice, and things will go well for\u00a0you. God delights in blameless people, and he abhors people with crooked\u00a0hearts. Beauty without discretion is an incongruous\u00a0waste."

Avoid\u00a0Failure End with\u00a0Success People want your brand to participate in their\u00a0transformation Implementation Websites Corporations Marketing\u00a0Roadmap Premise People want to survive and thrive. They are the main character in the movie of their own life and they have problems. Life is busy and hard and complicated and they don\u2019t want to waste energy figuring out if you can help\u00a0them. Good marketing shows that the product has an obvious benefit for the customer. How does your product improve someones ability to \u201csurvive and\u00a0thrive\u201d? Cut through noisy and challenging world by having a super quick and easy to understand message. Don\u2019t be clever, be clear. Don\u2019t make the customer spend calories trying to figure out how they will benefit from your\u00a0product. Stories are intuitive and leverage many psychological features. They organise information in an intuitive way and are a great way to combat noise and gain attention. People are compelled to pay attention until all the \u201cstory gaps\u201d have been closed. Could a caveman look at your website and answer these\u00a0questions: What do you offer? How will it improve my\u00a0life? What are the next steps? Story\u00a0Gaps A gap between a character and what they want. Will they find their way to success, overcome their challenges,\u00a0etc. Cadence and momentum are defined by the creation and fulfillment of story\u00a0gaps. If you fail to define something that the customer wants, you fail to open a story\u00a0gap. This makes the story uninteresting because there isn\u2019t a question that requires an\u00a0answer. Story gaps work because we want things to resolve. It\u2019s like singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star but stopping before the \u201care\u201d on the last line. You need to hear the last note of the melody for the tune to feel\u00a0complete. Pare down the customers desire to a single focus. Make your brand known for single specific desire and helping people get\u00a0it. Don\u2019t clutter the story by diluting the hero\u2019s desire with other desires. You can eventually develop\u00a0subplots. Apple When Apple released the Lisa computer in 1983, Jobs bought a 9 page ad in the New York times listing the computers features. When Jobs returned to Apple after being fired, (and after partly founding Pixar, which tells stories) Apple became a customer centric company, and their marketing was about the customers. 9 pages became 2 words - \u201cThink Different\u201d. A message about their customers, and their customers need to survive and\u00a0thrive. Apple isn\u2019t the hero in the \u201cThink Different\u201d brand, the customer is. It\u2019s the same with Nike - the athletes are the heros, and you can become a (hero) athlete with Nike\u2019s help. Apple plays a role more like Q in James Bond, giving the hero what they need to\u00a0win. Stories A Hero \u2192 has a Problem \u2192 and meets a Guide \u2192 who gives them a Plan \u2192 and calls them to Action \u2192 that ends in Success \u2192 and helps them avoid Failure. Hero The customer, not you. You are the guide. The customer is the main character in their life and is battling internal and external adversity it order to survive and thrive. Heroes have weaknesses, the guide is usually the strongest\u00a0character. A story starts with a character who wants to overcome external challenges that pose internal and philosophical\u00a0problems. Your first task is to create a story gap that implicitly asks \u201cWill the hero get what they\u00a0need?\u201d You need to define the character\u2019s ambition at the beginning, so that the audience knows what\u2019s at stake and what kind of a story it is. This messaging implicitly tells them how they could benefit and why they should spend\u00a0attention. Problem Customers are more motivated to solve internal problems than\u00a0external. If you identify a customer\u2019s problem then you show that you understand them. This is a great hook because they will then relate to your\u00a0narrative. The more we talk about the problems our customers are experiencing, the more interest they will have in our brand. Every story needs a villain, which is the personified problem. The germs are personified, envy is personified, etc. The diminished social status is personified by someone with more status being\u00a0villainized. The villain should be relatable - readers should recognize that the villain should be\u00a0disdained. should be a root source - frustration is what the villain makes us feel. High taxes are the cause, and are therefore the\u00a0villain. should be singular - just one villain, keep it simple to cut through the\u00a0noise. should be real - don\u2019t be a fear monger. Fight a real problem on behalf of your\u00a0customers. There are three types of problem External - A barrier to stability that must be removed - My business isn\u2019t growing fast enough, profits are too\u00a0small. Internal - I have self-doubt. Do I have what it takes to\u00a0succeed? Philosophical - I deserve to be successful, my hard work should be rewarded. Failure would be\u00a0unjust. The villain initiates an external problem that causes the hero to encounter an internal problem that is philosophically wrong or unjust. The purpose of the external problem is to manifest the internal problem. Customers should recognise and relate to both types of\u00a0problem. Put your product in the context of a type of survival they they want. Otherwise there isn\u2019t a story gap. Translate the external problem into several survival\u00a0categories: Resources - Conserving or accumulating money or\u00a0time Social - Gaining status or a social\u00a0network Generosity - Most people are not as Darwinian as we\u2019ve been led to believe, they want to be empathetic and\u00a0caring Purpose - Give customers an opportunity to be generous and participate in something greater than themselves - \u201cthe chief desire of man is not pleasure, but\u00a0meaning\u201d. The only reason that customers buy is because the external problem that your product would solve is causing an internal frustration. If you identify and articulate that frustration, and then clearly, confidently and repeatedly offer to solve it along with the original external problem then you bond with your customer. You\u2019ll have positioned yourself more deeply into their internal narrative and substantially differentiated your\u00a0brand. Philosophical problems are important because people want to be involved in something larger than themselves. It adds depth and meaning. Representing (and solving) a philosophical problem gives customers a way of expressing themselves that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise\u00a0have. If you can resolve all three problems in the same transaction, then customers will experiences a wave of relief and pleasure, and love your\u00a0brand. When Anakin Skywalker blows up the Deathstar by aiming the perfect shot, he defeats the external problem (the enemy army), his internal problem (self doubt) and the philosophical problem\u00a0(injustice). Your CTA is the action that must be taken to close the final story gap Checklist: Is there a single villain that your brand stands\u00a0against? What external problem is that villain\u00a0causing? The internal problem is probably found by considering how the external problem makes your customer\u00a0feel? What is unjust or wrong about the suffering caused by that\u00a0villain? Our hero is being challenged - will they be able to solve their problem? The only way to find out is to engage with the brand. Guide Customers aren\u2019t looking for another hero, they are the hero in their life. They are the main character which the movie of their life revolves around. They\u2019re looking for a guide because they need\u00a0help. A persons life is made up of many acts - \u201cdoorways of no return\u201d. Each life is unique but we all have commonalities. We are all on transformational journeys with common\u00a0elements. Story chapters are book-ended by events. These events are always instigated by external actors or events beyond their\u00a0control. Heroes need a guide who is trustworthy and earns respect. If they didn\u2019t need a guide their wouldn\u2019t be narrative, or a problem. Everyone is looking for a guide to help them solve their\u00a0problems. We wake up each morning self-identifying as a hero. We are troubled by internal, external and philosophical issues. We know that we can\u2019t solve our issues on our own. This insight has consequences and raises questions, it means our story isn\u2019t about us but about others. We can aspire to be someone else\u2019s guide, but not their hero. It shows why the search for meaning is innate, but can only be resolved by becoming a servant or\u00a0guide. Stop losing sleep over the success of your company and start losing sleep over the success of your\u00a0customers. In stories, heroes are not the strongest characters, they have self-doubt and are often ill-equipped. They are often reluctant, and are thrown into the story by external events. They are \u201cchosen by\u00a0destiny.\u201d In contrast, the guide has already \u201cbeen there and done that.\u201d They have already conquered the hero\u2019s internal and philosophical challenges in their own\u00a0backstory. The guide is the one with authority which the authority instinctively recognises and accepts. The guide has much more authority than the hero but the main character is still the\u00a0hero. Those who realize that the epic story of life is not about them end up winning in the end. This is paradoxical. Those who think they are a hero and win usually end up being remembered as a\u00a0villain. Characteristics of a\u00a0guide Empathy and Authority are a precise one-two\u00a0punch. 1. Empathy \u2192 Understanding \u2192\u00a0Trust When we empathise with customers we show that we understand them, and understanding produces\u00a0trust. People want to be seen, heard and understood. This is the essence of\u00a0empathy. Key phrases in your marketing copy could\u00a0be: we understand how it feels to \u2026 no-one should have to experience \u2026 like you, we are frustrated by\u00a0\u2026 Expressing empathy isn\u2019t difficult. Once you\u2019ve identified your customers internal problem, let them know that you understand and would like to help them find a\u00a0resolution. Brains like to conserve calories, energy, effort, time, so when a customer realises they have a lot in common with a brand, they fill in any gaps with trust. A customer will \u201cbatch\u201d their thoughts, which means they are thinking in chunks rather than in details. Commonality, whether in music taste or values, is a powerful marketing\u00a0tool. 2.\u00a0Authority No one likes a know-it-all and no one wants to be preached at\u2026 But people do want you to establish competence. When looking for a guide, a hero trusts someone who has demonstrable competence. The guide should have some serious experience helping other heroes win their day, but doesn\u2019t need to be\u00a0perfect. There are four ways to add authority (competence) to your marketing without being\u00a0arrogant: Testimonials Logos Statistics Awards Meeting a brand is like meeting a\u00a0person, Can you help them live a better life? Can they associate their identity with your\u00a0brand? Can I respect this\u00a0brand? Can I trust this\u00a0brand? Recap We started the narrative by identifying something that the hero\u00a0wants. Then we created intrigue and tension by defining the hero\u2019s problem. The audience wants to know if we can help them overcome the\u00a0problem! Then we introduced ourselves as the guide and established authority, empathy and\u00a0trust. What next? Making a purchase always involves a small risk of wasting money. This risky element makes a purchase somewhat similar to starting a relationship. There is a potential downside, the customer might end up feeling foolish and regret their\u00a0decision. Imagine a customer trying to cross a river to get to their purchase. They can hear the sound of a waterfall downstream. If they try to cross it by making a purchase then there is a chance that something bad could happen. Put stones in the river so they know how to safely walk across, step by\u00a0step. The stones are the\u00a0plan. Plan In a movie, the guide gives the hero a plan. The plan tightens the focus of the movie and creates a \u201cpath of hope\u201d for the hero that might, possibly, lead to the resolution of the hero\u2019s problems. It creates a story gap and implicitly creates questions that the audience want to be\u00a0answered. A good plan removes risk and explains what to do. If we don\u2019t guide customers, they experience a little bit of confusion and use that confusion as an excuse to not\u00a0purchase. Even though the setup or purchase or after-purchase steps are obvious to us, they are not obvious to customers. Give them a plan and they will feel more confident about\u00a0purchasing. Heroes trust a guide who has a plan. People are looking for a philosophy then can embody, or a series of steps they can take to solve their\u00a0problems. Customers want to know where you can take them. Unless you can take them somewhere they want to go, why would they listen? The marketing goal is that every potential customer knows where we want to take them. Define a desire for your customer, and your marketing story will have a powerful\u00a0hook. There are two kinds of plan. Both work by earning trust and offering the customer a clear path to\u00a0stability. Agreement\u00a0Plan Process\u00a0Plan Process\u00a0Plan The minimal (3 - 6) steps required to buy or get benefit from the product after purchase, or a mixture of both.\u00a0E.g. Make an\u00a0appointment. Allow us to create a customized\u00a0plan. Let\u2019s execute the plan\u00a0together. A process plan removes confusion from the customers journey. When they see the plan they think \u201coh that\u2019s not difficult, I can do that\u201d and then they\u00a0purchase. A post-purchase process plan would alleviate confusion about how the customer would use the\u00a0product. Agreement\u00a0Plan Agreement plans are about alleviating fears. It\u2019s a list of agreements you make with the customer that are designed to alleviate their fears of doing business with\u00a0you. An agreement plan can also work to highlight shared values. Give the agreement plan a good name and it can increase the perceived value of your product. \u201cthe easy-installation plan\u201d, \u201cyour best nights sleep ever\u201d,\u00a0etc. Agreement plans can work in the background, they don\u2019t have to be on the landing page, though they could\u00a0be. Make an agreement plan by creating a list of all the things a customer could be fearful about when doing business with you (haggling for price, interacting with a pushy salesman, buying a defective product) and then create an promise that would nullify that\u00a0fear. A Call To\u00a0Action So far, we\u2019ve defined a desire, identified their challenges, empathized with them, established our competency and given them a plan. Heroes only take action when challenged by an external force. They don\u2019t take action by themselves, they must be challenged. This is just how humans\u00a0are. We are the external force that guides our customers to\u00a0success. Heroes need to be challenged by external forces. Calls to action should be clear, and should be repeated over and over. Above the fold, in the center of the page. Also in the navbar. And also repeatedly as they scroll down the\u00a0page. Customers are bombarded with adverts and calls-to-action all day every day. They are ignoring things and filtering out noise all the time. So don\u2019t be shy or subtle. Be very clear. Make it very simple. If you have confidence in your product, make confident calls to\u00a0action. Direct\u00a0Calls Buy\u00a0Now Schedule an\u00a0Appointment Order\u00a0Now Call\u00a0Today Register\u00a0Today Repeat the same (singular, simple) call to action again and again down the\u00a0page. Transitional\u00a0Calls Download our free PDF guide to growing your\u00a0business Free information - advice, guides, whitepapers,\u00a0reports Giving something away for\u00a0free Testimonials Samples Free-trials A good transitional CTA does three things: Changes the customers perception of you - it establishes your expertise and\u00a0authority. Creates reciprocity, you offer them something of value before you ask for their\u00a0money. Positions you as a guide for the next\u00a0steps. Use both types of CTA (direct and transitional) in your messaging. Then customers will understand (simply and without burning calories) what you want them to do in order to solve their\u00a0problems. What is at\u00a0stake? Stories live and die by a single question; \u201cWhat is at stake?\u201d If nothing is about to be gained or lost then nobody cares. If there is nothing at stake in the story then there is no story, it\u2019s just not\u00a0interesting. If there is no benefit to buying the product, then why buy\u00a0it? You have to show the customer the cost of not buying the product. Avoid\u00a0Failure The story remains interesting as long as the hero is teetering on the edge between success and failure. A hero in a story only ever has 2 motivations - to escape pain or experience something good. Life is like that too, our desire to avoid pain motivates us to make a\u00a0change. There needs to be meaningful and consequential stakes in the story, otherwise it isn\u2019t interesting. Each scene needs to move the hero either closer to or further from their tragic external\u00a0threat. A brand needs to answer the \u201cwhat if I don\u2019t buy\u201d question otherwise the customer can\u2019t answer the \u201cso what?\u201d question - the stakes need to be clearly, simply, concisely communicated. Probably stake, not\u00a0stakes. You can do it humorously or lightly. Don\u2019t make a big negative scary thing out of it - failure is salt to add flavor, not a main marketing ingredient. Compare the fear to the peace and stability that could be achieved. If you show the pain \u201cbefore\u201d and contrast it to peace and stability \u201cafter\u201d then you\u2019ve opened and closed a story\u00a0loop. Blog titles, email subjects, headlines, can all contain elements of potential failure to convey a sense of urgency. Bring up the negative stakes a\u00a0bit. People fear losing $100 more than they desire gaining $100 - loss and pain is more motivating than reward and\u00a0peace. Recipe Let the reader know they are vulnerable to a threat. \u201cX% of Y get\u00a0W\u201d Let the reader know that since they are vulnerable, they should take action to reduce their vulnerability. \u201cMake sure this doesnt happen and protect\u00a0yourself\u201d Give the customer a clear, concise simple plan to reduce their vulnerability. \u201cWe offer the thing you\u00a0need\u201d Challenge people to take the next step right now. The CTA. \u201cCall us today to arrange an\u00a0appointment\u201d Agitate a bit of fear, and then return the reader to peace and prosperity, all within 1 or 2\u00a0paragraphs. What are you helping your customers avoid? It\u2019s only a little salt to add flavor. If it\u2019s too little, customers won\u2019t know why your product is important. If it\u2019s too strong it\u2019ll be\u00a0off-putting. End with\u00a0Success Humans are looking for resolution to their external, internal and philosophical problems. They can achieve this though status, self-realization, self-acceptance, and transcendence (among other things). If you product or service can help people achieve this then it should be a central part of your brand\u00a0promise. People want to change their lives and be taken into a new reality. Tell them how their lives are going to improve - peace, status, confidence, abilities,\u00a0preparedness. People want a vision of a happy ending. Compare these two statements: \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a man on the moon\u201d or \u201cWe would like a highly competitive and successful space\u00a0program\u201d Use this table to show how your customer\u2019s lives will change. It will give lots of good copy for your\u00a0marketing: Before your brand After your brand What do they have? What are they feeling? What\u2019s an average day like What is their status? Talk about the end vision really clearly. And use images of happy, successful, powerful people enjoying the benefits of your product. Say the benefits loudly, confidently, clearly, simply,\u00a0repeatedly. Talk about your end-vision for their lives once they\u2019ve benefited from your\u00a0service. Show the customer a vision of how great their life will be if they do business with\u00a0you. Ultimately, the end of the story should be a list of resolutions to your customers problems. How do they feel and how have philosophical/justice questions been resolved? Stories usually end in one of three\u00a0ways: The hero gains status or power Offer access - get a free\u00a0coffee. Offer a premium - skip the\u00a0line. Create scarcity - write \u201climited\u201d on\u00a0it. Identity association - wear a Rolex and be associated with what Rolex stands\u00a0for. The hero becomes whole by being unified with someone The hero needed something they couldn\u2019t get themselves, and external provision has saved\u00a0them. Reduced anxiety, or more\u00a0security. Reduces effort, or more\u00a0convenience. More time, reaches an aspirational\u00a0lifestyle. The hero has some internal realisation (coming of age) that gives them confidence to overcome their circumstances or internal shortcomings and become \u201cwhole\u201d and wise. They can achieve inner peace and know they reached their potential. Inspiration - chariots of fire - you can also run really\u00a0fast Acceptance - fashion brands doing positive body\u00a0image Transcendence - greater purpose and meaning - fair-trade\u00a0coffee People want your brand to participate in their\u00a0transformation A hero needs someone else to step into their life, tell them they are different and special and better. That someone is a guide, that\u2019s\u00a0you. Offering an aspirational identity to our customers adds a lot of value to our products and services. Realise that your customers want to transform and improve\u00a0themselves. People are looking for a guide. Everybody wants to change either into someone better or someone more self-accepting. You are helping them become wiser, fitter, more equipped, accepted or\u00a0peaceful. What does the customer want to\u00a0become? what is their aspirational\u00a0identity? what kind of person do they want to\u00a0be? How do they want their friends to talk about\u00a0them? Being a guide is a position of the heart, not just a marketing tactic. Lose sleep over your customers problems instead of your business. Commit to solving their internal, external and philosophical problems, and give them a vision to aspire\u00a0to. Customers needs to be told very clearly how much other customers have changed and how far journey has taken them. Usually, the hero is deeply flawed right up until the final climactic\u00a0scene. Not all elements of a story should be used\u00a0evenly. Implementation Websites Above the fold, use the one-liner. It\u2019s one sentence saying what\u2019s in it for the customer. What problem do you solve, what aspirational identity do you offer. It will also give customers words they can use to tell others about your\u00a0business. Big obvious calls to action, in multiple places. Don\u2019t be\u00a0timid. Customers read in a Z\u00a0shape. People don\u2019t read websites, they scan them. Repeat the important things so that they are understood by quick readers. Use very few words. The fewer words you use, the more likely they will be\u00a0read. Perhaps 10 sentences on the entire landing\u00a0page Increase the amount of text towards the bottom. The top needs to be short, fast, positive and\u00a0obvious. Use a \u201cread more\u201d button to expand longer text, then customers have the option if they\u00a0want. Place a transitional call to action next to the main call to action. \u201cDownload a guide\u201d next to \u201cbuy now\u201d. Put the transitional CTA in less bright\u00a0colors. Repeatedly ask people to buy, twice above the fold and then in subsequent sections. If you don\u2019t tell people what to do then they won\u2019t do\u00a0it. Include images of success - people enjoying the benefits - resolved problems, aspirations achieved, closed story loops. A sense of health, well-being and\u00a0satisfaction. The flow of the landing page should follow the StoryBrand framework, albeit not\u00a0exactly. Corporations Not applicable, but if you\u2019re a manager and you give your team a narrative they can fit themselves into I guess they\u2019re going to have more purpose, confidence and\u00a0meaning. Marketing\u00a0Roadmap Create a one-liner. Say how can you make their lives better in an engaging\u00a0way. Create a lead generator and get qualified email addresses. A guide, a free 30 minute consultation, a voucher,\u00a0etc. An automated email campaign - a weekly email, 3 with nurturing advice and then 1 with a CTA. All\u00a0automated. Collect and tell stories of transformation. Almost all stories are about the transformation of the hero. Tell this story and people will understand what you are\u00a0offering. Create a system that generates referrals. If word of mouth is so powerful, incentivize\u00a0it. One-liner The one-liner is a statement. It could be more than 1 sentence, but its supposed to be super short. It\u2019s the equivalent of a logline for a movie. Keep editing it until you find a version that\u00a0works. Memorizie it, put it on your website, and include it in every piece of marketing collateral you\u00a0create. You could tell this to anybody and they would understand what you\u00a0do. Helps people realize they need your\u00a0services. Provoke imagination and\u00a0intrigue. It should include: A character (\u201cA busy mom\u201d, \u201cA\u00a0retiree\u201d) A problem - don\u2019t miss an opportunity to talk about a customers challenges. Define the problem as vitally important, it opens a story gap and customers will want you to close\u00a0it. A plan - hint at it. You can\u2019t explain it all in a\u00a0one-liner. Success - paint an image of life after a custom has bought your\u00a0services. Example answers to the question \u201cWhat do you\u00a0do?\u201d: \u201cWe provide busy moms with a short, meaningful workout they can use to stay healthy and have renewed energy\u201d vs \u201cI run a\u00a0gym\u201d. \u201cWe help retired couples who want to escape the cold avoid the hassle of a second mortgage while still enjoying the warm beautiful weather of Florida during the winter\u201d vs \u201cI got involved in real estate a few years ago and when we had out second kid we moved to Florida and\u00a0then\u2026.\u201d Create a lead\u00a0generator A guide to\u00a0download. A free webinar or online\u00a0course. Software demo or free\u00a0trials. Free\u00a0samples. Live\u00a0events. No need to reinvent the wheel, what are others\u00a0doing? You can give away quite a lot of value that is easy to consume in an email or PDF - people will consume it quickly and will probably be happy to pay for a chance to learn in a more thorough and detailed\u00a0context. Downloadable guides etc should be about 3 pages in\u00a0length. Be generous, explain the \u201cwhy\u201d and give away as much of the \u201chow\u201d as\u00a0possible. An automated email\u00a0campaign Even if customers don\u2019t click the links in the email, they keep seeing your brand and they become familiar with it. When they need your services you will be the go-to brand in their mind. The relationship and association is already\u00a0built. Nurturing emails and Call-To-Action emails - 3:1 - put real value in the nurturing\u00a0emails. Don\u2019t be passive in the CTA emails - you want them to buy, so tell them, repeatedly, and make it\u00a0easy. Talk about a\u00a0problem Describe a product you offer that solves the\u00a0problem Describe what life can look once the customer has bought your product and solved their\u00a0problem Call the customer to an action that leads directly to a\u00a0sale. Similar to a nurturing email, a direct action email also describes a problem and a solution, but in the direct email the solution is a product you sell and there is a strong call to action. A lot of the content can be taken from the StoryBrand\u00a0script. Collect and tell stories of\u00a0transformation A great testimonial gives customers the gift of going second, and lowering the riskiness of\u00a0purchasing. A good testimonial\u00a0will: showcase the value you\u00a0create the\u00a0results the\u00a0experience what transformation has\u00a0occurred? Few things are more important to a good story than a hero that experiences an external and internal and philosophical transformation. This is because everyone desires to be transformed in\u00a0someway. People love businesses that help them transform in some\u00a0way. Questions to get a good testimonial: 1. What was the problem you were having before you discovered our product? 2. What did the frustration feel like as you experienced that problem? 3. What was different about out product? 4. Take us to the moment when you realized our product was actually working to solve your problem? 5. Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved or being\u00a0solved? Create a system that incentivizes\u00a0referrals Identify your existing ideal\u00a0customers Give them a reason to talk about you - create a video or a PDF that a customer can send to their friends to help them introduce your brand and explain the value you\u00a0deliver. Offer a reward - a discount, more access, extra samples,\u00a0etc"

Drink liquor (or red wine) 3 or 4 times a week (after each workout). Try to be happy, optimistic and relaxed. What are you working so hard for anyway? You need something to do, someone to love, something to hope for. Longevity Calculations I was playing with the life expectancy calculator at blueprintincome1 and was surprised to find that their regression technique gives me a 50% chance of living to 95! I\u2019d expected a result closer to 80. After printing out a 90 year calendar, my next thought was to play with the calculator to find the maximum age I could have a 50% chance of reaching. Doing the factors below would apparently give me: 75% chance of living to 92 50% change of living to 101 25% chance of living to 107 Don\u2019t workout every day There is no additional benefit from working out more than 4 times a week. Once you\u2019re fit and working out 4 times a week it doesn\u2019t matter if you do more exercise. Being in \u201cexcellent\u201d health is better than being in \u201cvery good\u201d health though, so make the workouts count. I guess if it didn\u2019t make a difference then it wouldn\u2019t be excellent in the first place. Drink more alcohol I was surprised that having 3-4 drinks each week increases your life expectancy. I thought that it was best to not drink any alcohol at all. I should be drinking red wine or liquor 3 or 4 times each week. Liquor increases longevity in men, but reduces longevity for women. Red wine increases longevity in women, but has no effect in men2. I guess I should drink some rum after each workout. Weight doesn\u2019t make a different According to their regression, my expected longevity is unchanged within a weight range of 78kg - 90kg. I guess it\u2019s much more important that I\u2019m in \u201cexcellent\u201d health, working out 4 times a week and having some wine, rum, or whiskey after each workout. But it\u2019s just statistics The calculator only asks for quantifiable or physical attributes. It doesn\u2019t consider emotional, relational or spiritual factors.There is also a more detailed calculator at projectbiglife, its calibrated for Canadian citizens. \u21a9Alcohol consumption in later life and reaching longevity: the Netherlands Cohort Study \u21a9"

Willy Woos \u201cdouble top\u201d chart suggests a peak around $400,000. RationalRoot\u2019s comparison of bull runs suggests a market top around 14 September and a maximum price around $2,000,000 [sic]. RationalRoot\u2019s comparison of 12 months RSI suggests that the market top is reached shortly after a 12 month RSI exceeds 90. This seems less reliable than the above points Jurrien Timmer suggests a peak price around $100,000 if price shoots up unexpectedly quickly. I expect the market top to be significantly higher. $100k will be a massive psychological level. If the price does increase to this level before approximately July then the optimal sell price would therefore not be exactly $100,000. Market top is expected around September 2021 at the earliest. The behaviour of the market will change as its participants change. There hasn\u2019t been a bull run with significant institutional investors before. Sell using a cost averaging strategy. Awareness Buy when everyone is selling, sell when everyone is buying. Be brave when there is fear, if there is no fear then its about to get very messy. If everyone is super confident that prices are definitely going to go up, something bad is about to happen. A lack of uncertainty is a big warning bell. 14 September, $300,000.

It is the cumulative sum total of daily market cap values divided by the age of the market in days. Top Cap Average Cap multipled by 35. NVT Cap A valuation using monetray velocity. Checkout CoinMetrics for more info. MVRV The ratio of Market Value to Realised Value is calculated by dividing Bitcoin\u2019s market cap by its realised cap. Realised Cap The sum of the products of each UTXO and the market price of Bitcoin when the UTXO was generated. Market Cap The price of the most recent Bitcoin transaction multipled by the number of Bitcoin UTXO Unspent Transaction Outputs. These are kind of like unspent coins. If you have 1.5 BTC then you might have bought 2 and sold 0.5. The total value of UTXOs in your wallet will be 1.5. SOPR The Spent Output Profit Ratio is a measure of the average profit or loss on a coin. Is a coin is moved when the price is higher than when it was received the SOPR increases, if a coin is moved when the price is lower than when the coin was received then SOPR decreases. It won\u2019t be accurate for individual coins but in aggregate it gives an idea of whether coins are being sold at a loss or for profit. Market participants who have owned BTC for 3 months behave differently to those that have held BTC for 3 years. A more experienced investor will likely make more measured and less rash decisions. By segregating the UTXOs according to age you can compare old coins and new coins, experienced and inexperienced investors (in aggregate). Weak hands will sell before stronger hands, and when market price decrease it\u2019s useful to know aggregate age data for the coins being sold. If coins are moving from young wallets then the selling is likely much less significant than if coins are being moved onto exchanges from old wallets. aSOPR The Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio is the same as SOPR but it ignores coins less than 1 hour old. If profits are taken by old coins, aSOPR trends higher. It will trend lower when older (and therefore profitable) coins remain dormant. The higher aSOPR is, the more profit has been taken off the table. When aSOPR is less than 1, spent coints are moved at an aggregate loss. URPD UTXO Realised Price Distribution - If a lot of coins have moved within a particular price band, it is likely that there is strong price support and resistance at this price. This would be truer and more reliable in a mature market. Because the market for Bitcoin is expanding so rapidly and the price is so volatile, the attitudes and expectations of market participants is also much more malleable than in traditional finance. For example, what was considered a very high price 12 months ago would be considered a disaster today. RSI The Relative Strength Index is borrowed directly from traditional finance. You can calculate it over different time periods. Miner Net Position Miner Net Position shows the degree to which, on aggregate, Bitcoin miners are profiting from the coins they\u2019ve generated from mining. Miners are expected to be among the most bullish of all market participants, and therefore it is notable when they start moving coins from their mining wallets into exchange wallets. Stock-to-Flow A stock to flow model is used to measure the scarcity of a commodity. It\u2019s a calculation based on the ratio of existing supply and how much is being produced. The higher the ratio, the longer it will take for supply to meet existing demand. Gold has a stock to flow ratio of 66, which means it would take 66 years at the current rate of production to produce the amount of gold currently in circulation. Silver has a S2F ratio of 74. BTC has a S2F of about 50. Background Over the past 8 years, Bitcoin has gone through phases of rapid price increase followed by periods of rapid decrease. The price has been driven by increasing market size and a decreasing rate of issuance, and has been so volatile (compared to traditional finance) that \u201c1 month in cryptocurrency markets is like 1 year in traditional markets\u201d. However volatility is decreasing and we are seeing lower highs and higher lows during each subsequent market cycle. The single biggest factor driving multi-year market cycles appears to be the decreasing rate of supply increase (the issuance rate). The last 3 halvings1 seem to have provoked the last 3 bull cycles. We are in the third bull cycle now (April 2021) and I fully expect it to be followed by a bear cycle. As an amateur investor, I want to buy low and sell high. I\u2019d like to time the top and bottom of the market with reasonable accuracy, just like everyone else. But I\u2019m aware that my methods are less nuanced than professional traders and analysts - I have access to less data than them and I\u2019m not willing to put in as much effort as they are. I\u2019m happy to do this Pareto style - I\u2019ll give it 20% of my maximum effort and I\u2019ll be happy with 80% of an ideal result2. This is a review of what I consider to be the best sources of metrics and analysis that I\u2019ve come across. All the resources used in this article are attributed to the original author and have been made freely available on Twitter. I hope its OK for me to repost them here, if it\u2019s not then let me know and I\u2019ll edit the post.

The last halving occurred in May 2020 and the rate of issuance halved from 12.5 BTC/block to 6.25 BTC/block \u21a9I realise this probably isn\u2019t, strictly, what Mr. Pareto was thinking when he published his research. I hope you get my intention. \u21a9"

He spends 15% of his time on engineering. Probably it was more when he was setting stuff\u00a0up. The methods described in the post are definitely not the best way. It\u2019s just one way of doing engineering in a very specific type of business. It\u2019s not the only\u00a0way. Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Python, AWS, Redis. - same as MoneyBar and\u00a0PipPip.

Uses Datadog for monitoring and alerting, and\u00a0PagerDuty. Uses Rollbar, which seems similar to\u00a0Sentry. Uses Slack, not to talk with humans, but integrations with Rollbar and Datadog, and also slack incoming webhooks to be notified when someone signs up or does something interesting like deletes a\u00a0thing. Make a \u201cding\u201d sound whenever someone signs\u00a0up. He\u2019s always very careful about operational stuff to prevent downtime and outages. Servers are over-provisioned to protect against spikes caused by sudden media\u00a0interest. Avoids working from home or cafe cos its more productive in an office. Productivity is important - make every minute count. He doesn\u2019t often work more than 8\u00a0hours/day. He optimizes for spending less time and making money instead of more time and saving\u00a0money. Uses Vagrant and virtualbox on an MBP so that dev work is on the same systems as prod\u00a0infra. Uses 1 monolithic repo. Likes this\u00a0approach. He uses contractors!! Usually, the biggest obstacle to building and shipping things is overthinking. What if this, what if that. You are not important at all and no one cares. No one sees. Even if you screw up the initial product launch, no one will care because they\u2019re not looking. Only when you\u2019ve proved that you deserve their attention will you have any attention and\u00a0visibility. Think big, start small, act fast. Use boring technology, or whatever tech you want. Just make sure you\u2019re solving an actual\u00a0problem. Ignore the cargo cult people and ignore the noise. Keep calm and carry\u00a0on.

The SSH daemon listens for connections on a specific port (22), authenticates connections requests, and (if the connection request is approved) it will spawn the correct environment. The correct environment is a terminal\u00a0session. The client (the computer you connect from) must be running an SSH client, which is a small app that can communicate using the SSH protocol. (A protocol is a set of rules.) It needs to be able to receive information about which host to connect to, which user to connect as and which credentials to use when trying to\u00a0connect. Authentication Passwords and\u00a0Keys Clients authenticate using passwords or keys. Passwords are less secure than keys. Keys are very secure. You can also connect using no authentication by specifying a particular IP address I\u00a0think. Passwords are encrypted, and are conceptually familiar, but can (and will) be brute forced. There are tools that will block repeated attempts or block/allow authentication attempts from particular IP\u00a0addresses. SSH keys using public and private (or secret) key pairs and are very secure. Keys are generated in pairs. The public key can be shared freely without concern. The secret key must be kept as secure and secret as a\u00a0password. To authenticate using a key pair, the client must have both keys (a key pair) on their computer. The server must have the public key in a file called authorized_keys. If the server has the private key then something has gone wrong and you should be\u00a0alarmed. The server stores the public keys of users who can connect as a particular user in the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. The file contains a list of public keys, one public key on each\u00a0row. The default location to store the public key on the remote server is in the users home folder in a subdirectory called .ssh/authorized_keys. The full path would be ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Handshake When a client wants to connect to a server using SSH, it tells the server which public key to use. The server then checks in the authorized_keys file for the public\u00a0key. A unique session ID is generated and shared between the client and\u00a0server. If the server has the same public key that the client sent when it began the connection attempt, the server generates a random string and encrypts it using the public key. This random string can only be decrypted using the private (secret) key associated with the public\u00a0key. The server sends the encrypted string to the client. The client decrypts it using the secret key and combines the original random string with the session ID. The client then hashes the combined string and sends the hash back to the\u00a0server. The server already has the hash of the string combining the original random string and the session ID. If the hash from the client matches the hash on the server, the server can be sure that the client has the private\u00a0key. Source"

 "tags": "linux ",			"body": "Table of Contents Background Razor One Question Command Reference Links Background Chezmoi seems to be dotfiles management for power users. Until a few days ago, when I realised I\u2019d massively broken a lot of things, I\u2019d been putting my dotfiles in a version controlled directory and using a shell script to generate symlinks in my home directory. This had worked really well for several years. It\u2019s a great system for maintaining dotfiles on a single machine. But it\u2019s not robust or flexible enough for managing multiple machines or multiple operating systems. Also, it\u2019s not just files that sit in $home anymore, I need to track configuration files that live in other places too1. I needed something more robust and flexible than generating symlinks from a bash script. Razor I think I read somewhere that when purchasing a new appliance you should buy the cheapest you think you can get away with, and if that doesn\u2019t work then get the best you can afford. Moving from a custom bash script to Chezmoi is an example of this. My custom bash script was the most basic approach, and it broke badly. Chezmoi seems like the most heavy duty tool for dotfiles management I could find. For example, I think I\u2019m able to encrypt my files using 1Password or similar. I can use Jinja templates to create scripts for different scenarios. I don\u2019t even know what that means at the moment. I\u2019ve only scratched the surface but I\u2019m happily managing dotfiles across different machines and updating/modifying them safely. Chezmoi (aliased to cm) is free and OSS so I\u2019m confident it\u2019ll be \u201cmy\u201d tool for the next few decades. I\u2019m happy to invest a couple of hours to learn a few new habits and iron out a few wrinkles2. One Question I don\u2019t understand why chezmoi cd creates a new shell in order to jump into the Chezmoi directory. Why not simply cd into the Chezmoi directory? What\u2019s the advantage/necessity of a new shell? You have to remember to exit after you\u2019ve done whatever you went there to do, but my habit is to cd or z ... I guess it\u2019s nice to exit and then immediately go back to where ever you were before, but there are other ways of doing that - you could write the current directory to an environment variable. It seems unnecessarily complex. Command Reference Show which files have changed \u2192 cm status List of managed files \u2192 cm managed List of unmanaged files \u2192 cm unmanaged Start tracking a file \u2192 cm add Update a file, add the file again \u2192 cm add ..

I guess this is to be expected as experience increases but nonetheless it\u2019s gratifying to realise.Dotfiles management was a fairly new and interesting concept when I first began symlinking into my home directory. It still feels amazing to bootstrap a fresh machine and have it feel like home in just a few minutes, but the technicalities of it are now familiar. \u21a9"

Background The\u00a0hack Remediation Questions Study Comments Don\u2019t post secrets to public GitHub\u00a0repositories. I made this mistake a while ago, and in the interests of openness and learning from others, I\u2019d like to describe what happened. Maybe it\u2019ll help others avoid the mistake, and maybe I\u2019ll learn something from any conversation this article\u00a0generates. Background Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I\u2019ve been doing some work across multiple compute instances. Thankfully, the work wasn\u2019t business critical or on production systems. My account was isolated away from the rest of the\u00a0business. As the number of servers I was working with increased, I realised I needed to begin using some tools to automate server setup. This lead me to begin using Ansible, and once I\u2019d cobbled together a working playbook I pushed my Ansible project to my GitHub account\u2026 And accidentally leaked the key for an account I\u2019d been\u00a0using. The\u00a0hack Within a couple of minutes of pushing the repository to GitHub\u00a0I: Made the repository\u00a0private. Stopped tracking the keys in git and removed them from the cache git rm -r --cached \u003cdir\u003e. Received an email from Google saying they\u2019d found leaked\u00a0credentials. OK, close call. The secret was leaked for less than 5 minutes. On my obscure personal\u00a0GitHub. I thought there was nothing to worry about.. But then I noticed some activity in the\u00a0console. Compute instances were being created, I could see the list growing rapidly. Over the next few minutes 195 compute instances and disks were being created, each with a unique name in zones across the world. The format of the name was node-\u003ctype\u003e-\u003cnumber\u003e. Where type was either application, backup, jenkins, gke, prod, staging, worker, www, build, redis, or runner. Maybe some others too. The number seemed to be 5 random\u00a0digits. Some of the instances were ephemeral. They all had delete protection enabled. I checked the details of a few of them and noticed some scripts that included references to\u00a0Monero. So I guess a Monero mining bot was being set\u00a0up. The logs showed that GKE and networking resources had also been requested, but the account which the stolen credentials belonged to didn\u2019t have the necessary permissions. Our project also maxed out its quota of compute instances in multiple regions and\u00a0zones. Remediation I deleted the account that had been leaked, and began quantifying the damage. I wanted to know exactly what permissions the key had, which resources could be created, and could the leaked account be used to create other accounts? No, it\u00a0can\u2019t. After looking around and becoming confident that it was only 195 compute instances with disks and delete protection that had been created, in regions and zones across the globe, I began to remove them. No other resources had been\u00a0provisioned. It took me 10 minutes and some googling to create the following\u00a0workflow: Get all the compute instances and dump them into a file. I expected to run a script that iterated through the file line by line, setting variables based on the content of the current line: gcloud compute instances list --format \u0027csv[no-heading](name, zone)\u0027 \u003e names.txt In Vim, find the rows that contain the instances that I don\u2019t want to delete, and remove these from the file. There are a handful of compute instances I want to keep, and 195 that I want to remove. :v/node- shows any rows that don\u2019t include\u00a0\u201cnode-\u201d Loop through the file and for each row, which contains the instance name and its\u00a0zone, Remove delete\u00a0protection Delete the\u00a0instance while IFS=, read -r name zone do gcloud compute instances update $name --zone $zone --no-deletion-protection \\ \u0026\u0026 gcloud compute instances delete $name --zone $zone --quiet done \u003c names.txt The --quiet flag is necessary because otherwise gcloud will ask me to confirm that I want to delete the instance\u00a0otherwise. Questions I\u2019m surprised by the speed with which the attacker found the leaked credentials. The repo did not belong to the clients account but my own, and I assume that my account is obscure enough to not be on any interesting lists. If my account is being scanned every few minutes, presumably all accounts are being scanned\u00a0regularly. How many resources are required to do that? I guess if one of these attacks works you can use the stolen compute to scan more repositories for more leaked credentials. It\u2019s easy to imagine scenarios where large corporations that are already running complicated cloud infrastructure deployments wouldn\u2019t notice a few (200?) unauthorized compute instances\u00a0running.

The rosetta api spec is super interesting, but like most things in crypto the documentation is sometimes wrong or incomplete and there are bugs and undocumented\u00a0features. Each of the nodes runs on a separate server, and we typically have one node for mainnet and another for testnet. I\u2019m working across mutiple servers, doing difficult stuff, and I want it to be as easy as\u00a0possible. I need to reduce friction and cognitive\u00a0load. Accessing the servers is easy - I use Tmux with the continuum and resurrect plugins and maintain different sessions for each type of server. This makes accessing multiple servers during the same work day really simple and effortless. But working on the servers is still\u00a0awkward. On my dev machine I have zsh with syntax highlighting, command completion, and various tools, like z to make navigation supper easy. I also have a lot of aliases defined. E.g. .. \u2192 cd ... Working on a remote server should be as convenient and familiar as working on my local machine, so I want to find a way to configure a server the same way as my laptop, and I want to do it automatically so that it can be done many times, with no additional\u00a0effort. Ansible Ansible seems to be popular\u00a0because: It\u2019s\u00a0free It\u2019s got all the features and capabilities you\u2019re going to\u00a0need It\u2019s agentless - you don\u2019t need to install anything on the machine you want to control - you can use Ansible with anything that you can ssh\u00a0into. I used the following resources to get\u00a0started: This useful video gave me some orientation and helped me figure out what I was aiming for and how to get started. Before watching it, I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhich way was\u00a0up\u201d. This blog post showed me how to create an inventory using the gcp_compute plugin. I spent a lot of time being unnecessarily confused about service accounts. I guess until you have 1 success at understanding something you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve misunderstood by a little or a\u00a0lot. Once you have an inventory of servers that you want to connect to, you still need to specify (and prepare for) how you will connect to them. I\u2019d hoped that the gcp_compute plugin would do some heavy lifting for me in this step, but it seems not. It can do lots of useful stuff like creating instances and specifying disk space and networks, but it won\u2019t really help you ssh into an instance. No matter\u00a0though\u2026 This blog post turned out to be just what I needed. I found it at the beginning of my search when I was trying to create an inventory, and discarded it as almost useful. Turns out that OS Login is the best way to ssh into a GCE instance and once you\u2019ve got your inventory taken care of, this blog post really\u00a0helps. When I was installing python modules, I had some errors about pyenv shims being incorrect. The scripts were looking for versions that weren\u2019t present. Running pyenv reshash fixed it. Kind of magically, but\u00a0annoying. Setting up a service account and giving it the correct permissions took more time and was more confusing than anything to do with\u00a0Ansible. I found this blog post about setting up vim for yml files. The preferred way to install ansible on Mac is using pip. When you use OS Login the username you have when you ssh into the compute instance will change. This SO question explains\u00a0why.

Some of these improvements\u00a0are: Adding keyboard shortcuts (type ? to find out\u00a0which). Implementing, then reimplementing, and then optimizing client side fuzzy\u00a0search. Using src-set to serve responsive images (Image-Process). Lazy loading images to make this site load\u00a0faster. Compressing page files using brotli and also gzip (Precompress). Trying (and ultimately failing) to avoid a \u201cwhite flash\u201d when dark mode is chosen and a new page loads (Github discussion). I\u2019m not really sure why I did it. It makes almost no difference to anyone but me. It felt a bit\u00a0compulsive. I like tinkering, and it\u2019s nice to build something that will continue to work with no maintenance. I tell myself that over the next few years I will gain the benefits of these features even when I\u2019ve forgotten I implemented\u00a0them. It\u2019s taught me a lot of JavaScript, which is a great language to be familiar with - it\u2019s everywhere. I would warmly encourage someone younger than myself to pursue interests for the sake of curiosity and fun. And there is a very high chance that even if no-one uses the shortcuts except me, my new javascript skills will come in useful somewhere\u00a0else. But even if they do I\u2019m not sure its a good enough reason - things should be built when they solve a present problem, not over-engineered for what-ifs and maybes. YAGNI. I wouldn\u2019t let myself do this in a professional capacity. There is a tension between being curious and being\u00a0focussed. I\u2019m not really sure that I need to justify myself. Its a hobby, I wanted to do it, I enjoy tinkering with web technologies and learning new\u00a0things. But also, I lost sleep over this - I stayed up too late, and let it put pressure on other\u00a0things. I know that being curious, and making room to play with interesting things, has been one of the most useful approaches to personal development and up-skilling myself. But there must be a\u00a0limit.. There is a tension between wasting my time and taking a risk, and it will take a few years before I know for sure if these efforts were worthwhile, or\u00a0not. If it\u2019s not fun, don\u2019t do\u00a0it. Successful business owners seem to be very good at leaving things alone once they\u2019re \u201cgood enough\u201d, and not being perfectionists. In fact, I think that being a perfectionist is antithetical to being an entrepreneur. I am not a perfectionist, I\u2019m just really curious and have a big appetite for\u00a0learning. But this \u201cappetite for learning\u201d stops me from focussing. I let myself become distracted by adding new features to this blog, when instead I should zoom out a bit and think about working towards a more substantial and meaningful goal, to the exclusion of more minor\u00a0goals. I think that good entrepreneurs are very focussed, to a fault. I am not that focussed. I am too distracted by\u00a0life. It\u2019s a balancing act, there is a tension between being emotionally and physically present with my family and friends, and ignoring as many things as possible so that I can focus on doing something meaningful that is necessarily\u00a0hard."

 "tags": "fuse, search, web ",			"body": "Adding search made the site feel faster and more accessible I\u2019ve reimplemented search on this site using fuse.js instead of tinySearch. You can read about how I implemented tinysearch here. When I first implemented search I was surprised how much faster and more accessible the site began to feel. I could quickly access any content by typing a few words, I didn\u2019t need to scroll or follow a link.1 This means I can find content without having to think about how to get there - I don\u2019t need to break my flow or concentration. It might sound like a trivially small consideration, but lowering friction or cognitive load in small ways can make the difference between using or not using something when you\u2019re already working hard or concentrating on something else. For example, if I want to look up my notes about using the nohup command, I can quickly go to the site, type / (the keyboard shortcut for search), type \u201cnohup\u201d and hit enter. This is all muscle-memory level impulses. I don\u2019t need to think about the content, think about its category or when I posted it, then scroll down and scan a list, or use a mouse to click on intermediate links. Win. Working at the speed of thought rather than the speed of input is a big deal. Why I switched from tinySearch to Fuse.js Before implementing fuse.js, this site had a search feature powered by TinySearch. I wouldn\u2019t have had enough knowledge to implement fuse.js if I hadn\u2019t already learnt some JavaScript whilst setting-up tinySearch. TinySearch had an example for Pelican Blogs, and a simple and clear readme. By using tinySearch first I saw an example of how to build the JSON array that becomes the search index, and how to implement the javascript that\u2019s required for client side search. Also, in the course of developing and over-engineering this blog I\u2019ve become much more proficient and comfortable with JavaScript (and jQuery) in general. Fuse.js is really quite simple to set up once you\u2019re familiar with JavaScript. It\u2019s much more flexible than tinySearch; you can choose search weights for different fields, accuracy thresholds, and some parameters for the fuzzy search algorithm. The general approach is to instantiate an instance of Fuse by calling Fuse with a JSON array for it to parse, along with some options. You then give the instance a string and get back an array of results which you can do whatever you want with. The accuracy of the search results is higher with fuse.js and the speed is still acceptable. I did have to do some optimization of the search index that Fuse generates, though. Optimizing the search index The \u201cnormal\u201d search index that Fuse uses to return results is a JSON array of all the content of all the articles that you want to be able to search. You can generate it using a jinja template or any other way you want. (There simply needs to be a JSON array that the browser downloads and does a fuzzy search on). This gave me a file that was about 4MB. Once I asked Fuse to search the complete text of each article (not just the default first 600 chars, iirc) then speed really suffered. I optimized the index file in the following three ways: Removed any non-words. Some of my articles are jupyter notebooks that have been converted to articles (the plugin to do this is one of the reasons why I began using Pelican). When the index is built, lots of code and html gets included, which isn\u2019t helpful. Any \u201cwords\u201d that are more than 20 chars I just delete. Removed the 150 most common words. Any word that is in many articles is not useful for distinguishing between different articles, so they can be deleted from the index. They don\u2019t add any meaning. I wrote a short pipeline of shell commands using tr, sort, uiq to generate a file with a list of the most common words. I then wrote a python script to update the original search index by removing all the common words. Shortened any long words by only keeping the first 12 characters. If a word was 15 characters long, I simply removed that last 3 chars. I figured this would work fine because matching the first 12 characters would already be quite unique and give a good result. Doing these 3 optimizations reduced the file size by about 90%. Compressing the JSON using gzip or brotli makes the files even smaller, and now the amount of data transferred to the client seems reasonably small. (This is a static site, and therefore search has to happen client side.) The browser would still begin to lag as the search string length increased. It takes more time to search for a 10 character string than for a 5 character string, and initially fuse was doing a search every time a character was typed. I wanted the site to feel as fast as possible and thought that if search was paused whilst typing and occurred a short time after the last key was pressed this would be an improvement. I added a short delay of 200ms to the function call, and typing during the delay time resets the time. This reduced the lag and made the search tool feel responsive. I learnt that this is called \u201cdebouncing\u201d. There was some further complexity when I wanted to debounce characters used for searching, but not the navigation or keyboard shortcuts. Getting the debounce function to only run on some key presses was surprisingly complex. It taught me a lot of JavaScript though, and it\u2019s satisfying to have made a useful user interface.It also immediately gave me the idea to add keyboard shortcuts.

If you look on the Pelican plugins index you\u2019ll see that Tipue search is the only search tool with a ready-made Pelican plugin, but unfortunately the project seems to have died and the projects website is now something\u00a0else. But searching a static site must be quite a common need and googling for alternatives gave me a few choices. Lunr.js seems to be the most popular, but it also seemed fairly complicated and like it was probably more than I needed. I went with Tiny Search because it seemed to do what I needed and was easy to setup. There\u2019s even an example for Pelican\u00a0blogs. One hurdle to success was minimising the false positives. The default settings seem to prioritise keeping the size of the index small (tiny) over giving a good user experience. Maybe its because the amount of text on my site is significanly less, or more, than the typical use case. Either way, after checking the project\u2019s issues on Github I found an issue that matched my problem perfectly. The solution is to increase the tiny_magic variable at build\u00a0time. According to the Readme, this requires using a container and building the index using docker run.... Unfortunately the Dockerfile wouldn\u2019t complete without errors. Checking the issues again and adding to the discussion resulted in an alternative Dockerfile being suggested, which works. Woohoo! I could then build the search index with a massive tiny_magic value\u00a0(2048). Then something weird happened. I write in Vim and I use fzf to find and open files. I realised that fzf had stopped working. After some investigating, I realised it was only not working in the blog project, and that fzf.vim calls the fzf CLI tool, which in turn calls the ripgrep tool. The underlying issue was that ripgrep wasn\u2019t working, and after a few hours (sob) of debugging, I found out that one of the things that makes rg special is that it ignores stuff in your .gitignore file. Sneakily, and without me noticing, the Docker image for constructing the tinysearch files had created a .gitignore file with a single entry. The entry was *, which selects everything. So rg was ignoring everything, and giving no results. Which meant I couldn\u2019t find and open\u00a0files. I still don\u2019t know how (or which part of) the Dockerfile does this, so I\u2019ve created a .gitignore-master file which contains the correct content, and after I generate a new search index I replace the new traitorous .gitignore with the contents of .gitignore-master. I\u2019ll come back to it later when/if I have a better understanding of Dockerfile syntax, or\u00a0Rust. Adding search to the site made the content feel a lot closer and more accessible. Once it was working I immediately wanted to use some keyboard shortcuts to open the search box and select results. Kind of like tailwindcss.com does it. It feels really fast and\u00a0precise. Googling for some jquery packages, and also some vanilla javaScript showed me enough to get things working. You can hit / or ctrl-k or cmd-k and bring up a search box that populates results as you\u00a0type! Only whole words are matched unfortunately, but its still a super useful feature. The search index includes article content as well as article titles and categories. I\u2019d like to tweak a few of the keyboard shortcut behaviours, and add the contents of various pages (which aren\u2019t articles) to the search\u00a0index. Update I\u2019ve reimplemented search using fuse.js. You can read about it here"

			"body": "If many different customers are to deposit or send ADA (The unit of currency on the Cardano blockchain) to a Cardano node, it will be necessary to determine which customer is responsible for each transaction so that the correct customer account can be\u00a0updated. As with many things involving blockchains, this initially seemed like a simple requirement but involved several hours of\u00a0work. Cardano wallets are generated using a parameter called ADDRESS_POOL_GAP. The default value is 20, and is the number of unused addresses that the node will generate and return to a client using the REST API. If one of the addresses is used, the node will automatically generate another so that there are always 20 unused\u00a0addresses. This is probably very convenient for personal use. If I want someone to send me some funds, I can make a simple api call using cURL and get a fresh address. But if you are running a service, weather its e-commerce or a financial service, its not really good enough. Some advice on the forums says to generate a wallet with a very large ADDRESS_POOL_GAP value such as 10,000 and just generate a new wallet when you run out of fresh addresses, but it still feels like a\u00a0compromise. But lets explain our situation in more detail first. If a customer wants to send us some ADA, we want to give them a fresh address that\u2019s never been used before and that only they have. Then we know that any funds that arrive to that address are from a particular customer. However we don\u2019t know if the customer will actually use the address and transfer any funds. The address might remain unused or it might not. Nevertheless, that address is now reserved for them, and no one else can use\u00a0it. In this way, we might need to generate and maintain a list of thousands of addresses that are never used. Using ADDRESS_POOL_GAP for this seems like a bad\u00a0solution. Fortunately, Cardano-Addresses has the answer, albeit in a fairly convoluted and obscured form. If you have the mnemonic that was used to generate a wallet originally, you can generate 2^31 unique addresses like\u00a0so: Clone the repo and build the docker\u00a0image: git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet docker build -t cardano-address . Get the mnemonic and generate a file containing a list of space separated words on one\u00a0row. Run the\u00a0following: export increment=0 ((increment=increment+1)) \u0026\u0026 cat mnumonic.txt | docker run --rm -i cardano-address key from-recovery-phrase Shelley | docker run --rm -i cardano-address key child 1852H/1815H/0H/0/$increment | docker run --rm -i cardano-address key public --with-chain-code | docker run --rm -i cardano-address address payment --network-tag testnet \u003e payment.addr \u0026\u0026 cat payment.addr ;echo"

The Binance docs show a couple of ways to install a node. I used the install.sh script and went with default values as much as possible. Installation My first attempts to sync a full node used the install.sh script, but the node wouldn\u2019t sync completely, it would get stuck. I setup a new VM and did a manual install (\u201cOption Two\u201d) and so far the node has been syncing without any issues. You need to download the genesis file separately in this case. Also, be sure to download the node-binary repo using git lfs and not just git. It will look like it worked but bnbchaind wont have completely downloaded unless you use lfs It took me awhile to realise that the documentation assumes that you have an environment variable called BNCHOME. You can either create it using export BNCHOME=/path/to/.bnbchaind/ (like you would for any environment variable) or replace the environment variable in the start node command with the file path: nohup bnbchaind start --home BNCHOME \u0026 Note: I\u2019m not sure if the bnbchaind needs the environment variable to be set or not. It doesn\u2019t give errors if it isn\u2019t set, but I seem to be having more success when BNCHOME is defined. Syncing the node There are three ways to sync a node. Fast-sync isn\u2019t the fastest way to sync your node, hot-sync is. Using install.sh should put the correct default values in the $BNCHOME/config/config.toml file, but I needed to adjust ping_interval and pong_timeout to the recommended values. Surprises The documentation assumes you have familiarity with running tasks in the background of a terminal session, and that you\u2019re familiar with nohup. I wasn\u2019t - I\u2019d even forgotten what the \u0026 symbol does1 so I did some research and wrote some notesIt starts a process in the background.

Use nohup to ignore HUP signals One solution to this seems to be to use nohup, a command that ignores the HUP signal. It stops your programme from stopping if the terminal session its running in is\u00a0stopped. By convention, the HUP signal is the method used by a terminal to warn dependent processes that it is about to\u00a0logout. You probably want to run nohup in the background. You might want to prevent it from creating nohup.out. Close or redirect fd0 -\u00a0fd2 On Linux, nohup automatically closes stdin. If you\u2019re using MacOS or BSD this doesn\u2019t automatically happen, so you might want to redirect it yourself. This is because if a background process tries to read anything from stdin then it will pause itself whilst it waits for you to bring it to the foreground and type some input. This is probably a waste of\u00a0time. If nohup detects that you have redirected stdout and stderr then it won\u2019t create nohup.out. As with all commands, if you put \u0026 at the end of the command, it will run in the background. You can bring it to the foreground by running fg, or see a list of jobs by running jobs. If you redirect input to /dev/null (\u003c/dev/null) you will stop the program from receiving keyboard (stdin) input, but you won\u2019t prevent it from accessing the terminal directly. Also you haven\u2019t removed the program from the shell\u2019s process\u00a0group. Stopping signals using disown If you want to remove a program from the shell\u2019s process group, then immediately after you\u2019ve run the command to start your programme, run disown with no arguments. This will make the background process no longer associated with the shell job and it wont have any signals forwarded to it by the\u00a0shell. A disowned process gets nothing (no signals) sent to it by the shell. But without a nohup it will still be sent a HUP signal sent via other means, such as a manual kill command. A nohuped process will ignore any and all HUP signal, no matter how they are\u00a0sent. Source Update\u00a0(2021-03-31): Use w to see who is logged in and what they are doing. It\u2019s summary of every user logged into a computer, what each user is currently doing, and the load all the current\u00a0activity. It\u2019s a combination of who, uptime, and ps -a. Process\u00a0Groups A collection of one or more processes. It\u2019s used to control the distribution of a signal.

			"body": "/dev/null In Linux everything is a file, including virtual devices like keyboards. Processes (programmes) can request access to or from these\u00a0devices. The only difference between these virtual device \u201cfiles\u201d and real files, is that for a virtual device the OS generates the data that goes into the file, instead of reading the data from\u00a0storage. /dev/null is a virtual device that looks like a file and is used to write output into a black hole that is discarded, lost forever and never seen. It isn\u2019t written to the\u00a0terminal. File\u00a0Descriptors File descriptors are integer values assigned to a\u00a0file. stdin has a file descriptor of\u00a00 stdout has a file descriptor of\u00a01 stderr has a file descriptor of\u00a02 Two outputs are generated whenever a CLI is run stdout and stderr. By default, both these data streams are associated with the terminal. You can use file descriptors to redirect\u00a0them. If a command exits successfully, the exit status is\u00a00. If it exits unsuccessfully, the exit status will be something\u00a0else. If you don\u2019t specify which file descriptor you want to use, bash will use stdout by\u00a0default. The following redirects stdout away from the terminal and into /dev/null. $ echo \u201cHello World\u201d \u003e log.txt This will redirect stderr into a\u00a0file: $ asdfadsa 2\u003e error.txt If you run a command that generates lots of error messages along with \u201cgood\u201d messages, you can redirect all the error messages (stderr) into /dev/null so that you can only see the useful stdout messages.\u00a0e.g.: $ grep -r hello /sys/ 2\u003e /dev/null If you want to run a command and only see the errors, (stderr) then you can filter out all the stdout by redirecting the stdout messages to /dev/null: $ ping google.com 1\u003e /dev/null Redirect all output into /dev/null if you want a command to run\u00a0quietly, Redirect all the output. The command below redirects stdout to /dev/null (the default file descriptor is 1 if it isn\u2019t specified) and then redirects file descriptor 2 into file descriptor\u00a01. $ grep -r hello /sys/ \u003e /dev/null 2\u003e\u00261 Read input from a file instead of the\u00a0terminal 0\u003cinfile Direct stderr to append to a particular\u00a0file 2\u003e\u003elogfile Combining file\u00a0descriptors 2\u003e\u00261 means send stderr wherever stdout is going. This means that you\u2019ve combined stdout and stderr into one data stream and you can\u2019t separate them anymore. It also means you can pipe stderr the same as you can stdout. Input You can redirect stdin similarly. If you run \u003c/dev/null then if the program attempt to read from stdin then it will get\u00a0end-of-file. The merge (or redirect) syntax (for example \u003c\u00262) won\u2019t work, because you can only redirect in the same\u00a0direction."

Table of Contents Docker Compose Cardano wallet Cardano-CLI REST API Surprising things Docker Compose The Cardano Wallet repo1 contains almost all you need to get started. The command to run is: NETWORK=testnet docker-compose up -d This does a couple of things for you: Creates a Cardano node and begins syncing with the network Creates a Cardano Wallet instance Creates all the required data volumes Maps the ports required to make API calls. Running docker ps should show that two containers are running, cardano-node and cardano-wallet. Cardano wallet In order to run cardano-wallet commands (not using the API, but directly on the node) you\u2019ll need to docker exec into the container like this: sudo docker exec -it cardano-wallet_cardano-wallet_1 sh Then you can run commands like: cardano-wallet network information Cardano-CLI Similarly, if you want to use the cardano-cli programme, exec into the cardano-wallet container: sudo docker exec -it cardano-wallet_cardano-node_1 sh cardano-cli \u2014version REST API Perhaps you wont need to do this though because once the containers are up and running and online, you can use the REST API to monitor the node, make transactions, and watch addresses.2 For example, a good test to see if the node is ok is to run curl http://localhost:8090/v2/network/information Addresses on Cardano need to be BIP39 compliant, and before you can use the REST API to create the address you will need to have already generated the keys and the mnemonic. This can be done using various other tools (web page, python) and the results put into a JSON file according to the API spec. Surprising things Cardano requires that addresses are created sequentially and instead of allowing the user to generate them ad-hoc, the node by default will manage the creation of addresses of each wallet.3 The value of ADDRESS_POOL_GAP sets the number of unused addresses in each wallet. By default this is 20. When an address is used, the node will automatically generate a new unused address for the wallet, so that there is always a pool of 20 unused addresses.https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet \u21a9https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/postWallet \u21a9https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/docs/common-use-cases/how-to-create-addresses/ \u21a9"

The node only does this once it has caught up with its piers. Whilst it is still syncing it will only return the current highest block when you make the initial API call.

(I guess GH is contrarian in this\u00a0sense) Look for a problem that doesn\u2019t feel right. Then figure out how to do it\u00a0right. When people tell you that your (contrarian) approach is just no good, just keep at\u00a0it. Either your intuitions are good or they\u2019re not.

Sentinel Values Instead of setting your sentinel value to something that is not quite impossible, like None or \"None\" set it to object() This is better because it creates a unique instance of the object class and there can be no ambiguity about where it came from. A sentinel value is a value you can set a variable to. It\u2019s special because it differs from all other legal or possible values that the variable could have. It\u2019s used as a signal or as a canary that something (bad or unexpected) has happened.

			"date": "20 January 2021",
			"body": "The rules1 and mental models that helped me succeed in one season or phase of life may not be the best for the next phase. Here is a list of a few mental models I remember being concious of in previous years. Probably I\u2019ve already forgotten some. Always ask \u201cwhy\u2026\u201d. Be obsessive about this. It\u2019s going to make things harder for a while before things get easier. You\u2019ll find difficult answers that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t. If you\u2019re only concerned with the present then its true that ignorance is bliss, but otherwise it\u2019s a liability. \u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d is another good question to ask a lot. Adapt to the situation, don\u2019t make it adapt to you if you have any choice. Be kind of like water, going around things and through the gaps. Look for the edges and the gaps, the parts that aren\u2019t well known. Let people talk as much as they want to. Shut up and listen. If they mean you harm or don\u2019t respect you then it\u2019ll become more obvious the more they keep talking. If they mean you well or they\u2019re saying something useful, you will benefit more from letting them talk more. Inversion - it can be hard to know if you should do something, but how would you feel if you didn\u2019t do it, or if it didn\u2019t happen? Regrets are inevitable, everyone has them. Same as making mistakes. Let your regrets be for things that you did do, and not what you didn\u2019t do. If you are willing to try something, fail at it, and still be glad that you tried, then you should almost definitely do it. Commit to it and enjoy the experience! Don\u2019t be scared, or at least, be scared and optimistic and happy2. There is beauty and luxury in being in such a bad spot that you are backed into a corner with seemingly no way out. Things become black and white, instead of shades of gray, and that will make priorities and options much clearer. You are likely to work very efficiently and effectively in this scenario, and you will learn important things about yourself. Now that I\u2019m older and I have responsibilities, I can\u2019t ever let things become so bad that a situation becomes black and white. I have to navigate a world of grays. If they do become black and white, I\u2019ll already have a long list of failings. When I was younger, things were more fragile. My resources were smaller and things could quickly flip from good to bad. Enjoy the few benefits that a situation like that gives, because (hopefully) once its gone its gone for good. The best way to solve a problem is to prevent it from occurring in the first place. Succeeding at this will bring its own challenges. Take responsibility for things you are not responsible for, kind of. Do it deliberately and for your own benefit, but don\u2019t forget that you are only pretending that it\u2019s your responsibility. If you do this, you will force yourself to understand a situation more deeply and from other peoples perspectives. This will let you learn faster and help you in future. Keep this at arms length though - it\u2019s make-believe and you need to be able to switch it on and off. It\u2019s a toy for you to play with. This seems to be what \u201cextreme responsibility\u201d is.

It is easy to implicitly assume that all useful information is available to us, and that we are therefore more informed than we really\u00a0are. I think this is because the internet has made information more accessible and global air travel have made the world feel\u00a0smaller. Whilst an individual would hopefully never pretend to know everything, I think its easy to assume that the right information exists and is being used by the people to whom it is\u00a0relevant. But the accessibility of all information has put us in a situation similar to information scarcity. We still need to actively search for the information we want, because the information that comes to us easily or for free is not equal to what we find when we apply\u00a0effort. I can easily have so many short pieces of news or information that I am always slightly overwhelmed. The pace of modern communications encourages me to never slow down enough to form my own questions or frame my own arguments. I can always find an answer to my questions, but when was the last time I checked that whoever gave it to me wasn\u2019t going to profit from\u00a0it?"

We predict the future when we think about how risky or scary something is, or when we think about what\u2019s really going to change because of an announcement or press release. We try to predict the future when we\u2019re at the supermarket checkouts and we try to pick the queue that will move the fastest. I always seem to pick the wrong\u00a0one. There must be a million ways of trying to predicting the future but all the good ones are models which reduce complexity and emphasise key considerations. One of them could be comparing the influence of human nature and technology on the outcome, and then comparing the event to what\u2019s happened\u00a0before. Human nature doesn\u2019t change, so if something is driven by fear or greed then it probably doesn\u2019t matter what century it occurs in. Technology is change, and if something is enabled or prevented due to technological progress then the date is\u00a0important. What is driving the scenario? Is it human nature or technology? Supermarket checkouts are mostly manual and require a couple of adults to work together, so human nature has a much bigger role on efficiency than tech. Young men will stack and pack quickly, old women will be the opposite. What types of shopping bags they have, or how they pay, or even how many items they\u2019re buying, are probably not going to lead you to the right\u00a0decision.

			"date": "19 January 2021",
			"body": "Financial crises seem to happen fairly regularly so they shouldn\u2019t be unexpected. But no-one seems particularly concerned about our current financial system, at the moment our attention is controlled by other threats. I\u2019m concerned that a lot of money has been injected into the money supply but we haven\u2019t seen any inflation. And I am concerned that the price of stocks is no longer related to the value created by the company but instead by macro economics. It\u2019s a terrible time to be a value investor. This should be an alarming statement. Value investing should always be a decent way to make money unless markets are broken. If the price of something doesn\u2019t represent its value then a correction is inevitable. Interest rates are really low at the moment so if you have spare money and you want to make it work for you then where do you put it? Not into a bank account, because interest rates are low1, and not into government debt, because the yield is so low. It has to be stocks if you want the value of your investments to increase meaningfully. But everyone is doing this which drives the price up, and because their price is increasing they increase even further. I think that the main reason for concern is super low interest rates and massive increases in the money supply, but there are a couple of other factors that are also contributing. It\u2019s easier than ever for retail investors to participate in the stock market, and this seems like a good idea. Democratization. However if retail investors have influence to effect prices, and they themselves can be manipulated or influenced regarding what or when they buy or sell, then that is likely a new kind of threat to financial stability. We\u2019ve never seen social media combined with quick, cheap investment services for amateurs before. Index funds are also more popular than ever2 - the efficacy of index investing relative to traditional funds that use stock pickers is very high over medium or long time horizons because index funds are much cheaper. But if index funds become too large then they end up influencing the market in predictable and rigid ways. Index funds cannot choose what they buy or how much they buy - they just track the index. If a company\u2019s stock crosses certain thresholds, their stock has to be bought or sold. It seems like its possible to create feedback loops where funds have to buy more of a rising stock, which increases its scarcity and price, which then requires index funds to purchase more of the same stock. The amount of euros in existence in 2019 was 90% more than in 2010.3 But inflation between 2010 and 2020 is 13%.4 Why is that? If the price of something doesn\u2019t represent its value, then a correction is inevitable.Why are interest rates low? Because confidence in the economy is low, so central bankers have to lower interest rates to make it 1. Cheaper for a business to borrow money to invest in their business and therefore easier for a business investments to be profitable, and 2. So that its more attractive for investors to use their capital to invest in a business (which grows the economy) relative to depositing spare cash in a bank account (which is safer but a less efficient way to deploy capital). Interest rates affect the relative risk-reward ratios of different investment strategies \u21a9Index Funds Are the New Kings of Wall Street \u21a9statista \u21a9in2013dollars.com \u21a9"

			"title": "Debugging the more_categories plugin for\u00a0Pelican",
			"category": "Technical/Developer Tools",
			"url": "debugging-more-categories-pelican-plugin.html",
			"date": "19 January 2021",
			"body": "I\u2019ve realised that one of the plugins I use to make this blog is not working correctly. I use the more_categories plugin to: add subcategories assign multiple categories to articles. Subcategories aren\u2019t working and Pelican thinks each article just has categories than contain forward slashes. In his \u201cPowerful Python\u201d emails, Aaron Maxwell recommends looking at the source code for popular python libraries to see how really good Python is written, and how talented developers write code and solve problems. This is a good opportunity to look at the code that powers the plugin and see if if I can: Understand the source code Locate the source of the problem Fix the problem I don\u2019t know if Pelican is amazingly good quality or not, I get the feeling it could do with more developer resources, but I\u2019ve got a real reason and motivation to look at the underlying code so I\u2019m going to give it a shot. The documentation is sparse which doesn\u2019t help, I get the impression that whoever wrote it feels like Pelican is simple and it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s going on 1. It\u2019s not obvious to me. Pelican Plugins Every plugin has to have a register() function, here it is for the more-categories plugin: def register(): signals.article_generator_context.connect(get_categories) signals.article_generator_finalized.connect(create_categories) I understand the idea of signals from Django, and generators are discussed a bit in the documentation. So what else is happening\u2026 As I write down my understanding of the plugin, I\u2019m aware that my understanding is definitely incomplete and probably wrong. I hope that as I progress I will see the mistakes in what I\u2019ve already written. get_categories() is called first, and it takes two arguments, generator and metadata. The entire function is 3 lines so here it is: def get_categories(generator, metadata): categories = text_type(metadata.get(\u0027category\u0027)).split(\u0027,\u0027) metadata[\u0027categories\u0027] = [Category(name, generator.settings) for name in categories] metadata[\u0027category\u0027] = metadata[\u0027categories\u0027][0] It looks like it gets the category from the metadata for each article. Presumably by the time this function is called the articles have already been parsed and a metadata object has already been created and populated with metadata about the articles, including categories. The first row of get_categories() splits up the categories if multiple categories are listed. metadata must be a dictionary, and there must be a metadata dict for each article, otherwise you couldn\u2019t just get get the value assoiciated with the dictionary key and then split the string on commas. This means that this function is called once for each article. I don\u2019t know what text_type does yet. Maybe it ensures that the output is always a string. It\u2019s imported from six which I remember seeing being a dependecy of some other packages. .. Having checked the documentation for six it looks like I was right - it represents unicode textual data in both python2 and python3. Pelican was originally written in Python2 I guess. Next step is to write a new key-value pair to the metadata dictionary for each article. This plugin adds functionality to python by enabling categories and not just a category for each article. It seems clear that adding a categories key to the metadata dict is an obvious way to do this. The value for the categories key is a list where each item is an instance of the Category class. This class is instantiated using two arguments, name which is the string from the previous row, and generator.settings which is currently not understood. .. printing the contents of generator.settings shows that its a dictionary of all the settings. Easily assumed and good to confirm. I\u2019ll dig into the Category class in a moment, but first lets quickly cover the last row of the function. The category attribute of the articles metadata is simply updated with the first item in the categories list (categories must be a list because it can be indexed.) class Category(): This class is the only class defined by the plugin (which is only 96 lines of code). It has 6 methods, 5 of them are decorated, and it has no constants. The decorators are property [3], _name.setter [1] and URLWrapper.name.setter [1]. URLWrapper is imported from pelican.urlwrappers and I don\u2019t know what that does beyond \u201cwrapping URLs\u201d. @property Decorators are functions that takes methods or functions as inputs. Using property along with setter decorators lets a class have a property assigned to it whilst ensuring that arbitrary conditions or logic is upheld. If the @property decorator is over a method called foo, then there would need to be a decorator called foo.setter on a method somewhere in the class. That doesn\u2019t seem entirely right though, because in our Category class, we have a @property decorator over a _name method, and also a @_name.setter decorator over another method called _name. But the other methods with @property decorators (slug and ancestors) do not have any associated setter decorators or methods. The setter for _name seems to create parent categories if the string contains slashes: @_name.setter def _name(self, val): if \u0027/\u0027 in val: parentname, val = val.rsplit(\u0027/\u0027, 1) self.parent = self.__class__(parentname, self.settings) else: self.parent = None self.shortname = val.strip() Here, self.parent becomes an instance of the category class, that is instantiated using parentname and self.settings. This is recursive to however many levels of subcategories are specified. The ancestors and as_dict methods seem more confusing. ancestors isn\u2019t called or mentioned within the class definition, but is called from the create_categories function which is called after the get_categories function returns. I don\u2019t understand why it needs an @property decorator though. The class inherits from URLWrapper so that is probably the next best place to look\u2026 Indeed, looking at the definition of URLWrapper shows that the as_dict method is overriding the definition in the base class.I guess it\u2019s the \u201ccurse of knowledge\u201d \u21a9"

It\u2019s partly a journal of how I\u2019m teaching myself to be a developer and a data scientist, and it\u2019s also a personal blog, with articles about my interests and experiences. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone is interested in every type of article, and I\u2019d like to make it easy for people to only read the content they\u2019re interested in. Therefore I thought I would separate the articles into two broad groups, technical and non-technical. If you visit this blog for the first time by clicking a link to a technical article, the site will then only show you the technical articles on the blog. It\u2019s the same for non-technical articles. If you want, you can change these settings by clicking the paw icon1 in the navbar on the blog index page. I did this mainly because I could. I like playing around with the blog. The JAM stack feels accessible and its fun working with tailwind and with jQuery. I think that playing (being curious, lighthearted, and unhurried and not being concerned with failure) is really important. Especially for adults who don\u2019t usually do it much. Most of my successes or big opportunities have been the result of a process that started with playing around. Here is the list of requirements I used when adding the feature: Requirements: If user lands on a page and DOESNT have local setting - create local setting based on type of article being read If user lands lands on a page and DOES have local setting which is contradicted - reset local setting to \u201call\u201d If user lands on index and DOES have local settings, only show articles that match the setting Steps: Index page: check if local storage option exists, print to console the result Index page: make button group Index page: make correct button active on page load by using localstorage Index page: update active button on page click Index page: filter/unfilter articles when button clicked Index page: if local storage does exist, respect it Index page: add 3 stage switch to hamburger menu Index page: make hamburger menu behave intuitively on small screens Index page: if local storage does not exist, pop up a modal asking for a choice Article page: check if local storage option exists, print to console the result Article page: if local storage doesn\u2019t exist, create it according to article type Article page: if local storage does exist and is contradicted, update article type to all It\u2019s a paw because cat\u2019s have paws and cat is like category. I might change this to something more intuitive in future, like making the icon an N if the user is only seeing non-technical posts, T for technical, and A for all posts. \u21a9"

			"title": "3 Different Types Of Programming\u00a0Problems",
			"category": "Technical/Web",
			"url": "different-types-of-problem.html",
			"date": "18 January 2021",
			"body": "Three categories of problem Last year when I was creating moneybar and pippip there were a few problems that took much more effort to solve than all the others. I think I could group problems into 3 buckets, based on how much time they take to solve. Type 1 takes less than 15 minutes to solve, type 2 takes between 15 and 45 minutes to solve, and type 3 takes more than 45 minutes (usualy much more). Type 3: When I start learning a hard thing (like web development), almost everything is in the third bucket and it\u2019s exhausting. You need to set aside big chunks of time, you need to be focussed and undistracted, calm and wide awake, and you need to be prepared for a long arduous journey. Probably your criteria for success should be \u201cam I dead?\u201d because then if you\u2019re asking the question you\u2019re guaranteed to be successful and keeping morale high is necessary for success. Type 2: Hopefully you can make good progress understanding the basics and internalizing the relevant abstractions, and your problems quickly1 become type 2 problems. They each take from 15 to 45 minutes to solve. Maybe this is because you know enough to break some big general problem into smaller problems (you are developing domain expertise) and your intuitions for how to solve the problem are becoming better so your first or second attempts are likely to be correct, rather than your fifth or sixth. Knowing how to google a problem so that you get the answer you need is also a really important skill, which requires intuiting how an English speaking expert would ask the question. This isn\u2019t trivial but I don\u2019t hear people discussing this often. When most of my coding problems are type 2, it feels like I\u2019m learning most efficiently and when I\u2019m most productive2. Type 1: After a while, the problems that need to be solved become type 1 problems. They take less than 15 minutes to solve, because: All the big problems have been solved and now you\u2019ve only got smaller problems left, and Your intuitions are good and your expertise has increased and you know where to look for answers.3 Exceptional problems: But there seems to be a consistent exception to this model.4 Let\u2019s be silly and call them type W problems. These are the problems that eat up far too many hours, and are tiring to solve, even when you are (in most other respects) an expert. For me, these tend to relate to blob storage solutions for web apps deployed into production. I can think of several factors why this is so, and I\u2019ll describe the specifics before generalising. When a web app runs in production, the data is not stored on the web server because the things that make a web-server cheap and efficient are not the things that make a database or a file storage bucket cheap and efficient. Therefore they are stored somewhere else and you need some plumbing to join everything together. There are some abstractions involved to make this work easily and securely. However when developing locally, you are doing everything on your laptop. You have a web-server, relational database and file system all in the same place. This is a big, fundamental, architectural difference between your development environment and your production environment. As a general rule, these are supposed to be as similar as possible. These differences make it much easier to make something that works locally but doesn\u2019t work in production, and it\u2019s very hard to test if a thing will work in production without deploying it to your staging environment, which you are likely less familiar with than your local development setup. Deploying to staging and debugging on staging is slower and harder than doing the same thing locally. Logging (and filtering) will likely be more important. Solving exceptional problems So how do you solve these problems quickly and efficiently? What is it about this problem that makes it so hard? Let\u2019s examine what makes the problem difficult to solve: Iteration cycles are slow - I can\u2019t test locally, I have to deploy to staging and this takes time. The problem occurs in a \u2018high friction\u2019 environment - its difficult to dig around and figure out what\u2019s really going on when its hidden below 3 different layers of abstraction, on a remote machine that I have limited access to via a web browser. I want to be able to dig and investigate quickly and easily using the same tools I use for writing and testing code locally. I\u2019ve taken great efforts to set up my local development environment so that I can do this, and its stressful to switch to a different and more limited set of tools. The problem is the result of several things interacting at once, and I can\u2019t just test things one at a time. These things are probably very similar to the abstractions. Thinking clearly, learning, buidling, solving problems, all rely on being able to separate or untangle a seemingly complex situation into its component parts so that you can figure out what causes what. If you can\u2019t isolate individual concerns or components, you have a black box that is keeping you ignorant. In web development, customized logging is usually a good way to being isolating and exploring particular components. Having said all that, I think the best way to solve a problem is to prevent it from occurring in the first place, but I\u2019m not good enough to figure out how to do that, yet.on which timescale? Life is long, does it really matter if it takes 1 week or 1 month to learn something meaningful? Momentum, and having fun, is important though. \u21a9from a personal growth point of view. I suppose from an employers point of view they want all problems solved fast, type 1 problems. \u21a9Open the right file, google the right query (and follow the link to stack overflow), make some changes, run your static type checker and linter, run your tests, and push. Done and on to the next item. \u21a9which is totally fine. It\u2019s just a mental model, and the map is not the territory \u21a9"

Writing forces me to organise my thoughts and look at how substantial they really are, or aren\u2019t. There is truth in the saying that \u201cto know a thing you need to be able to teach it\u201d 1 , and writing well has several similarities to teaching. Can I really copy a collection of thoughts from my head to yours? Powerful ideas are resilient and have many consequences. The older I get the more I believe that ideas matter2. They have so many subtle consequences. They are the first dominos. I don\u2019t expect writing regularly to become a permanent habit - it doesn\u2019t need to be. But I do want to focus on it for awhile so that I become significantly better. It\u2019s a skill that has too many benefits to be ignored. The blogs I remember most are focussed and unapologetic about their priorities. Most of them have a lot of text and do not focus on design. They make it easy to read content and don\u2019t spend time or attention on header images or styling. Before I redesigned this blog I had default settings that asked me to supply an image for each post, and for a summary, and a suggested tweet. None of it was necessary and whilst they all tried to make the blog better they ended up making it harder to write. These peripheral features added complexity and distracted from the main thing. They\u2019re are still there if I want to use them but they are not set up to be used by default anymore. They\u2019ve been moved to the background and if I forget they exist then that\u2019s OK - it just shows they weren\u2019t as important in practice as I thought they would be. I was probably just having fun adding new features and working out how to build them. You Ain\u2019t Gonna Need It, mate.Wikipedia article, and some external validation. \u21a9A complimentary notion is that asking the right question is more important than finding the right answer. I guess asking the right question is always necessary, but finding the right answer is only sometimes sufficient. Sometimes you can get the answer a bit wrong if you asked the right question, and still get enough benefits to avoid the problem. \u21a9"

Below are some of the most useful plugins and features I\u2019ve started using this year when I was building Moneybar and learning how to use\u00a0Django. There\u2019s a copy of my .vimrc at the\u00a0end. I\u2019m happy to invest time and effort learning how to make the most of Vim and its plugins. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll still be using it twenty years from\u00a0now. Filetype plugins - if you want some settings to be active only for particular filetypes, like .py (python) or .txt (text) then create a file in ~/.vim/ftplugin/\u003cfiletype\u003e.vim. Vim will look in this file when it opens a buffer of the corresponding file type. Good for formatting options like line length, tab spaces, vim commands that are language\u00a0specific. You can\u2019t activate plugins in these files though. All the plugins have to be activated in your .vimrc in the usual\u00a0way. janko-m/vim-test - this plugin lets you runs tests without leaving vim. You can run the test that\u2019s nearest the cursor, or all the tests in the current buffer. It\u2019s very customizable. I wish it could be a bit faster, but I could probably improve that myself by changing some\u00a0settings. dense-analysis/ale - The incredible Asyncronous Linting Engine (A.L.E) applies fixers and linters to various filetypes, when you want and how you want. Super useful for writing tidy code and catching mistakes before the code is\u00a0run. junegunn/fzf and junegunn/fzf.vim - It took a little getting used to at first, but now I can\u2019t imagine not using a tool like this (this could be said about so many vim-related things). Use fzf to switch between open buffers, open a new file, search for files using the filename, or search within all the files in the project for specific\u00a0text. majutsushi/tagbar - This plugin opens a sidebar which contains a list of of functions and classes and methods (tags).

			"body": "Updated: 10 Feb 2021 I found a blog post which is surprisingly similar to my thoughts on RSS feeds, but better presented and thought through. The post mentions the idea that \u201cRSS is about capturing the long tail of blogs that don\u2019t post frequently\u201d 1. This idea crystalised why I was so glad I\u2019d started using RSS feeds again. If readers use RSS, then authors don\u2019t need to concern themselves with attention. This removes pressure on the author to post frequently and lets them focus on quality over quantity. News feeds and ad supported platforms have fundamentally different mechanics and incentives. With RSS I can let good quality content come to me, on its own schedule. I don\u2019t need to remember to look for it, and the authors don\u2019t need to remind me that they exist. Google Reader RSS is a very effective way of having good quality information come to you. Back in 2008, I used to use Google Reader to subscribe to RSS feeds. I was an aspiring photographer back then and I remember being subscribed to around 80 blogs. Each day I\u2019d read articles from whoever had posted something new, without needing to visit their websites or remember who they are or that I\u2019d subscribed to their blog. The authors didn\u2019t need to optimize their output according to an opaque and changing algorithm either - they didn\u2019t need to optimize article length, tags, post frequency, image inclusion or linked content. They could write how they wanted to, which I suspect leads to higher quality content. Social Media A few years later Google Reader was closed down, presumably because using RSS didn\u2019t fit with Googles advertising model. I was unaware of it at the time but I imagine it sent shockwaves through blogging communities and probably upended many businesses. I mostly stopped reading blogs. Facebook was growing fast, Instagram felt new and exciting, and content was moving onto \u2018platforms\u2019, or into walled gardens. And as they kept on growing the average quality of the content decreased. Twitter is like this now I think. There are some real diamonds to be found from time to time, but there\u2019s a lot of mud too. Mostly its just mud, but the occasional diamond can have outsized benefits. RSS isn\u2019t like this. I choose the contents of my \u2018news feed\u2019, and each article can be much longer than a Tweet, or a caption to a photo, or a status update. It\u2019s hard to write well and to create an interesting or useful blog post, and that makes it harder to dilute quality with entertaining distractions. I have complete control about what content I see, and I can change it whenever I want. The process is designed around me. Reeder5 I used netNewsWire for a few weeks, but it couldn\u2019t sync between my laptop and phone, so I bought Reeder 5. It\u2019s got a few unusual design patterns, but it works well and has all the features I want. I\u2019ve been unsubscribing from email newsletters and subscribing to the RSS feed instead. It keeps my inbox quieter, and it feels good to have a \u2018separation of concerns\u2019. It makes it easier to read interesting content without being distracted.https://marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss \u21a9"

			"url": "learning-to-django.html",
			"date": "14 January 2021",
			"body": "Table of Contents In the\u00a0beginning A personal finances\u00a0dashboard Learning\u00a0Django The best\u00a0moments In the\u00a0beginning I came to web development via business analytics. I was working as an accountant and Excel wasn\u2019t good enough anymore, so I looked around for a way to get started and came across Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks are said to be a kind of \u201cgateway drug\u201d to programming, and I think that\u2019s true. They\u2019re the easiest and fastest way to start programming that I\u2019ve come\u00a0across. When you\u2019re working in a notebook, its easy to get data, wrangle it, and show some results. But as soon as you can create a chart or some summary table you inevitably wonder how you can show this to people more easily, and publishing the results to a website feels like the best most general and versatile\u00a0solution. Unfortunately it\u2019s also the hardest, and so begins a long series of compromises and incremental progress. Learn to use a dashboarding API, and learn to create static sites. But the end-goal, the ultimate solution, is a data driven web app, with authentication, saved user preferences, scalable performance, and automatically updated data\u00a0sources. A personal finances\u00a0dashboard When I moved to the Netherlands, I wanted to use a personal finances dashboard to check weekly expenses. There wasn\u2019t a web-app that would do this (though there are a couple of apps that are trying) so I built my own dashboard. Then a few friends asked if they could use it too. They couldn\u2019t because it was just a dashboard and not a web app, but I thought this was a good reason to jump into web\u00a0development. It was a much bigger task than I anticipated. (And that\u2019s OK.) It took several attempts and was super frustrating, I would dabble for a few weeks, do a few tutorials, and then get completely lost when I tried to do something by myself. I\u2019d get disorientated working across many different files and trying to visualise which part of the Model-View-Controller model, or the request-response cycle I was currently working\u00a0on. I came to realisea that the mental load seems so large at the beginning because \u201cweb-development\u201d is really a whole stack of technologies and abstractions combined (or stacked) together. Many of these have to be used together at the same time before you can see any evidence of success at all. Learning\u00a0Django I think the hardest things about Django are not actually Django. You\u2019ll need to comfortable with classes and inheritance. You\u2019ll also need to be comfortable with working across multiple files, and have some tools for searching across all you open buffers, or all the files in the project, at the same time. You\u2019ll also need to be comfortable with version control (Git) and using the command line. Get familiar with stack traces\u00a0too. If you\u2019re familiar enough with all these things, so that using them doesn\u2019t feel new, but ideally feels familiar and comfortable, then I think you\u2019ll make quite quick progress with\u00a0Django. Django uses the Model-View-Controller model. Models are how django maps Python objects to items in your database (oh yeah, you need to be familiar with SQL too\u2026), Views are where requests are processed (also Middleware) and turned into Responses, which are then combined with templates (unless your building an API). You might notice I haven\u2019t mentioned what a Controller is - get used to information feeling incomplete whilst you\u2019re learning the ropes. It\u2019ll become clear soon\u00a0enough. The best\u00a0moments The \u2018curse of knowledge\u2019 states that once you\u2019ve learnt something you can\u2019t imagine or remember what it\u2019s like to not know it. Before that happens completely, I want to record some of the \u2018ahah!\u2019 moments of \u2018learning\u00a0Django\u2019. For context, I stopped working as a freelance data scientist in April and after a few weeks wondering if django and PostgreSQL and python was the way to go (yes it is. use boring technology), I began working full-time on what would become MoneyBar.nl. I called it \u2018myeuros\u2019 in the\u00a0beginning. The learning curve felt steep. I wanted to do things \u201cright\u201d the first time because I wasn\u2019t building a toy, and although I felt that hindsight would show this to be a mistake in terms of efficiency, I did it anyway because I have a hunch that following my compulsions sometimes makes life harder in the short term and better in the long\u00a0term. The best moments are usually preceded by the most\u00a0frustrating. Adding a unique identifier to an existing authentication\u00a0model I used pydanny\u2019s cookiecutter-django template. Honestly, by the time I\u2019d gone through the quickstart process and googled the nouns in all the questions (what is Sentry, what is Celery and what is a task que, what is whitenoise, etc.) I was already tired. Play with it a few times and come back to\u00a0it. Anyway, I wanted to start with authentication, because the project template has that part kind of up and rnuning for you out of the box. cookiecutter-django uses the Django Allauth package, which is awesome, and reliable, and fully featured\u2026 and extremely abstracted. Good luck looking at the module code and understanding it if youre not an\u00a0expert. I wanted to give each user a unique ID - a UUID when they signed up. This would be used in query strings instead of usernames or incremental keys. This was so hard the first time! And it turns out its not a trivial task, not if you already have a few users in your (test) database. Sure you can reset the database and start again, but experimenting like this is fairly complex. Understanding how the python model classes (the ORM) maps to the relations in the PostgreSQL databse was complex, and if I got confused, should I try to fix it by changing python Models, or editing migrations, or working on the database directly? Getting started is one of the hardest\u00a0things. After I\u2019d figured out authentication, I started creating models for other simpler data (transactions and bank accounts I expect). This was much simpler and faster. I remember driving home one evening thinking that if I could get this far then success was\u00a0inevitable. Testing\u00a0code Before long, testing each part of the app by hand when I added or changed a feature was no longer trivial. I needed to find some way of automatically creating users and checking that they could log in and access\u00a0views. I began working with pytest, and really found it hard to wrap my head around the idea accessing different parts of the app not by requests and responses but by accessing class methods\u00a0directly. I think its normal and good to code at the limit of your knowledge, where you know just enough to make a thing \u201cwork\u201d. But this approach falters when you want to then test what you wrote. Or at least, the measure of \u201cjust enough\u201d really changes when you require tests to be written. You don\u2019t just need to make it work, you need to understand why it works, so that you can write tests to assert that certain conditions pass and others\u00a0fail. This feels really satisfying when it works, because you have proof that you really have grasped a bigger picture. There are far fewer (relevant) black boxes when you write tests. But it also makes learning slower, at least in the short term. It means you might have two get comfortable with a handful of abstractions, when you\u2019ve already solved the problem you started with. This is frustrating, and it takes discipline to slow down, take a deeper look at the solution, and not just race on to the next\u00a0feature."

			"category": "Technical/Developer Tools",
			"url": "larger-code-bases.html",
			"date": "14 January 2021",
			"body": "Code\u00a0Structure One of the most immediate and basic differences between working as a data scientist or as a web developer is the number of files the codebase is spread across and the amount of code within each\u00a0file. Web applications tend to be very modular - there are a lot of different things going on in a modern web app and generally they all need to be able to be modified or updated independently of each other. This requirement encourages modular code base architecture with the code broken down into testable\u00a0units. When working on a data science project you often have a well defined and quite narrow pipe line. Each stage of a pipeline has well defined inputs and\u00a0outputs. This seems to have the consequence of making data science projects tend towards a handful of files each with a substantial amount of unique (not boilerplate) code. In web development there seems to be more boilerplate, many more files spread across a tree of directories, and the average number of lines of code per file is significantly\u00a0lower. IDE\u00a0features These differences mean that code organization tools and IDE features play very different roles within each industry. In web development you really need to be able to jump between different files (or buffers) quickly, and search for text across multiple files. Writing idiomatically becomes more important, and writing code within discreet testable units becomes essential so that things don\u2019t break without being\u00a0noticed. In data science, linting feels more optional, and searching for text within methods or functions outside the current module is\u00a0rarer. I didn\u2019t appreciate this until I paused my work as a Data Scientist and began building non-trivial web\u00a0apps."

 "tags": "python, django, testing, web-app ",			"body": "Test Driven Development was mind-bending when I first grappled with it: \u201cWrite a test for the code before you write the code\u201d \u201cAssert that your code matches your expectations by understanding all the inputs and all the outputs for every function or method I write\u201d. Last summer I was building a web app and began to break things unintentionally when adding new features. This soon led to lots of clicking around different pages to test if stuff was still working each time I made an update. This led to me thinking there must be a better way, which eventually brought me to Test Driven Development (TDD). It should have just led me to writing tests, which it did. But googling whatever I googled got me down the TDD rabbit hole rather than just the \u201cwrite some tests\u201d rabbit hole. Write tests for your code before you write the code. Write tests for bugs you\u2019ve fixed to check they stay fixed. Write tests as a kind of documentation to show what stuff is supposed to be doing. Errr\u2026 Django was a big enough pile of abstractions as it was. Views, ORMs, mixins, serializers\u2026 Trying to add factories and fixtures into that took some getting used to. But eventually I made some progress, and now I quite enjoy running coverage reports to keep coverage close to 100%1. Some of the main things I\u2019ve learnt about writing tests: Use PyTest as much as possible rather than other testing libraries - its assert statements are more intuitive than Django\u2019s own testing framework, and you can use it in any Python codebase, not just Django. It has lots of extensions and seems good at getting the job done fairly easily. Write tests as you go. I haven\u2019t (yet) reached the elevated level of writing tests before I write the code to be tested, though I see why that would sometimes be useful. I do think writing tests sooner rather than later is best though, ideally as soon as you\u2019ve got a basic version of your feature working. Use Coverage to show you which code is covered by your tests, and which branches or edge cases are not. But be warned, it doesn\u2019t tell you if the test is useful or not, only that it passes and which methods or functions it uses. Fixtures are great for keeping tests fairly DRY. Freezegun is great for testing anything to do with dates and times. Static type checkers, like Mypy, get more attractive in proportion to codebase complexity and size. Which is fun and all, but testing for the sake of it doesn\u2019t necessarily stop bad things happening. Its very possible to write a test that covers the code you\u2019ve just written without ensuring that only the intended behaviours happen. \u21a9"

			"title": "Why Talk About\u00a0Jesus?",
			"category": "Non-technical/Other",
			"url": "faith-in-jesus.html",
			"date": "5 January 2021",
			"body": "Start with happiness It seems to me that I am much happier as a Christian than I would be if I weren\u2019t. By \u201cbeing a Christian\u201d I mean following Jesus - trying my best to act, think and speak like he want\u2019s me to because I\u2019m grateful that he did what I believe he did. I believe he died for my sins and is now alive, having been miraculously resurrected by his father1 (who is now my father too). It\u2019s not just an intellectual exercise. I believe that Jesus is alive because I seem to have experienced his companionship and intervention in my day-to-day life. This is unusual, mind boggling, and makes things significantly more complicated than if I thought he were dead. Nonetheless it seems to be true. It\u2019s not like I see supernatural intervention every day or anything, but there have been various times - too many to discard - when my prayers have been answered in practical ways (I\u2019ll leave out the intangible for now) that have surprised me and given me a lot of respect for the risen Jesus doing what its said he\u2019d do in the bible. Obvious answers There was this time I was in Yemen trying to get back to my room across town, at night and during a storm. I was lost and couldn\u2019t read Arabic to understand which bus to get. So I prayed, and two buses later I got off at the right stop. Another example, I was getting a haircut in Liverpool Street Station in London, and as I was sitting in the chair someone took my work bag. When I came to pay, I realised my laptop and wallet had gone. Trying to find a stolen bag in central London feels ridiculous. Even so, I spent a few hours wondering around the alleys and parks looking for it, and I resigned myself to some awkward conversations and using most of my next salary to replace the stolen computer. To my surprise, my parents-in-law prayed about it and were really confident it would come back to me, which seemed super unlikely. A few days later I received a call from an office worker in the Gherkin building - my bag was under his desk and he wanted to know if I\u2019d like to collect it. I guess I\u2019ll try not to make the same mistake twice. The other example I tend to remember happened not long after I\u2019d first moved to Vienna. I was feeling lonely and isolated and I was wondering how on earth I was going to find some sort of normal that was healthy and sustainable. Try as I might, I wasn\u2019t enjoying things at all and was feeling stressed and overwhelmed. I remember walking up this steep hill in the 18th district towards my office, and repeatedly praying this really simple prayer \u2018God, please help, please help, please help..\u2019. It was that simple because I couldn\u2019t think of anything more useful to say. Nothing dramatic happened that day, or even that week as far as I can remember. But when I look back, it was a turning point when things started getting better instead of worse. I suppose you can call this last example an intangible answer to prayer. Maybe it is, but I think anyone whose grappled with overwhelming loneliness or panic would say that the emotions become all too tangible at times. Being in a different emotional state seemed to make a tangible difference to just about every area of life. Eating, productivity at work, relationships with friends and colleagues, etc. This is only the beginning of why I think Jesus is alive and why I think Christianity is a real and living faith. It\u2019s not primarily a tradition, a worldview or a set of rules and ideals. Christianity is a relationship with Jesus. He did lots of amazing things that have let me have a very practical relationship with him. It\u2019s an almost unbelievable premise from which to live a life. It has so many implications. And it holds up to scrutiny and my experiences bear it out. Why write this? Despite Jesus\u2019 incredible works and their implications, modern Christianity seems to be in a really confused and ineffective state. Ideas and thoughts about Christianity-the-faith have become mixed up with cultural christianity, or christian politics and traditions. These are each different things, and unless we distinguish between them with the words we use, we are going to find it hard to think and communicate clearly. I suspect that we are in a negative cycle of imprecise thinking leading to imprecise articulation, which leads to further imprecise thinking. Unless we can talk and think about one thing at a time, atomically2 if necessary, we take on the additional risks of reaching the wrong conclusions personally, or arguing with others due to misunderstandings rather than actual disagreement. We should try to create a more precise vocabulary to navigate our Christian lives, so that we can think clearly about the experiences and questions we have. Imprecise thinking is frustrating, and conversations are less effective when there\u2019s an increased risk of disagreement or misunderstanding what someone else means. This makes it harder to talk about our faith, which makes talking less common, and this creates room for misunderstanding or apathy, or missed opportunities, or sadness.And many other things also. \u21a9from first principals \u21a9"

			"body": "Some super brief notes I made about API\u00a0design: Background It\u2019s more of an art than a\u00a0science RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) API design is an architectural\u00a0style. Alternative API architectures: SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a heavier\u00a0style. GraphQL - doesnt overfetch. Graph query language made by\u00a0Facebook. APIs are everywhere (not just web APIs). They\u2019re an abstraction that hides an implementation. Django model managers are an API (and also part of Django\u2019s ORM), JavaScript is an API,\u00a0etc. RESTful\u00a0APIs Web APIs (all REST APIs?) expose a databases to\u00a0clients A rest api is a URL route (endpoint) that returns JSON or XML. POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, corresponds to Create, Read, Update/Replace, Update/Modify, Delete (HTTP methods correspond to CRUD\u00a0methods) HTTP METHODS: PUT (create or update) is idempotent, POST is not idempotent (keep on creating,\u00a0updating) PATCH - partial\u00a0update GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE methods are idempotent cos they are only designed for retrieving\u00a0data. DELETE HEAD - almost identical to GET, but without any body. Good for checking what a request would return, i.e. Before downloading a large amount of\u00a0data, OPTIONS - returns data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL. More loosely defined than other\u00a0verbs. Qualitative\u00a0Advice Use HTTP verbs to make requests more\u00a0meaningful Use sensible resource names. Naming things is hard, so think about this a bit before starting. Use identifiers in your URLs, not the query string. Good: /users/12345 Poor: /api?type=user\u0026id=23 Use the hierarchical structure of the URL to imply the structure of the API. Design (names and structure of things) for the user/client, not for the database. Resource names should be nouns not\u00a0verbs Use plurals consistently, not collection verbiage. Good: customers/123 Bad:\u00a0customer_list/123 Use\u00a0case-insensitivity. Use camel case or snake case\u00a0consistency Short is better than long, but be\u00a0clear Spend time on design before writing\u00a0code Use HTTP response codes to indicate\u00a0status Prefer JSON over XML. (Hotline does HTML..) XML requires schemas for validation and namespaces. Don\u2019t support this complexity at the beginning (or ever) unless required. If it is required, make the XML as similar to JSON as\u00a0possible. Put links in the HTTP link header, or use a JSON representation of\u00a0this. Use the HTTP location header to contain a link on resource creation, or for GET with pagination, use first, last, next,\u00a0prev. Connectedness - return links in the response which link to useful resources. At minimum, a link to show how the data was received, or\u00a0posted. Idempotence - clients making the same repeated requests create the same result on the server side. I.e. making repeated requests has the same result as making a similar request, server side. On the client side, a response code may change, of\u00a0course."

			"title": "Principles Of Object Orientated\u00a0Programming",
			"category": "Technical/Developer Tools",
			"url": "principles-of-oop.html",
			"date": "4 January 2021",
			"body": "I recently interviewed for a lead developer role at Lab Digital1 and thought it would be sensible to review some of the fundamental aspects of Object Orientated Programming (OOP). You might think that\u2019s a unusual way to prepare for an interview, and you\u2019d be right. Nothing close to these notes arose during the interview, but I find this stuff interesting. If I\u2019m motivated enough to study it, then I think that\u2019s a good enough reason by itself, without a specific reason. These are some brief notes. Object Orientated Programming has four key aspects: Encapsulation (Hiding information) Abstraction (Hiding the implementation) Inheritance Polymorphism 1. Encapsulation Each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Instance variables/properties/attributes are kept private and accessor methods are made public. Other objects don\u2019t have direct access to this state. They can only call a list of public functions (methods). The object manages its own state via methods, no other class can touch it unless explicitly (not default) allowed. Private variables. Public methods. You can define classes within classes, and functions within functions. 2. Abstraction A natural extension of encapsulation A concept or idea that is not associated with any particular instance. Expresses the intent of the class, rather than a specific implementation. Programs are often extremely large and separate objects communicate with each other a lot. This makes maintaining large programs difficult, and abstraction tries to solve this. Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it. This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant for the other objects. This mechanism should be easy to use and should rarely change over time. Implementation changes \u2014 for example, a software update \u2014 rarely affect the abstraction you use. e.g. a coffee machine. It does a lot of stuff and makes quirky noises under the hood. But all you have to do is put in coffee and press a button. 3. Inheritance In OOP, objects are often similar, sharing similar logic. But they are not 100% the same. Create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy. child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own unique part using method or attribute overloading. 4. Polymorphism Gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there\u2019s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are. This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods. Any time a collection (such as a list) or a method expects an instance of the parent (where common methods are outlined), the language takes care of evaluating the right implementation of the common method \u2014 regardless of which child is passed. I\u2019d like to be so familiar with the following features that I can use them without referring to notes: Getters and setters. Instance methods compared to class methods. Inheritance, mixins, and decorators. The \u201cmagic\u201d within the Django source code that requires mypy to use extensions in order to do its static type checking correctly. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get the job. They wanted a senior Python developer with experience with Infrastructure As Code, and also working at an agency. Can\u2019t win them all. \u21a9"

			"category": "Technical/Developer Tools",

			"date": "4 January 2021",
			"body": "As part of the redesign of this blog I wanted to make an article\u2019s category more meaningful. Previously, I simply picked a handful of categories and then assigned a single category to each post. This method becomes limiting when an article is relevant to multiple\u00a0categories. Also, using nested categories seems like a good way of grouping similar content and allowing more nuanced filtering of\u00a0interests. As I considered how to update the categories of existing articles, I realised this would be a good opportunity to practice analyzing and updating text files using unix\u00a0utilities. Here is how I reviewed and updated the categories of my existing\u00a0articles: I use Pelican to generate the static files for this site. It converts markdown into HTML. Metadata for each article is set at the beginning of a file, the title is set by typing Title: ... and similarly the category is set by typing Category: ... on its own\u00a0line. To locate, analyse and update my existing categories, I would therefore need to find all the markdown files which have a row that begins with Category: grep -h \u2018Category:\u2019 **/*.md - prints each search\u00a0result. grep -h \u2018Category:\u2019 **/*.md | sort - prints and sorts each search\u00a0result. grep -h \u2018Category:\u2019 **/*.md | sort | uniq -c prints and sorts each search result, then counts how many occurrences of each unique result there\u00a0are. I had some repeat results though because some rows had white space at the end, so in order to make these the same, I needed to remove trailing\u00a0whitespace: grep -h \u0027Category:\u0027 **/*.md | sed \u0027s/[[:space:]]//g\u0027 | sort | uniq -c This gave me the following\u00a0results: 6 Category: 2 Category:Data 16 Category:Disintermediation 2 Category:Engineering 2 Category:Front-end 15 Category:General 15 Category:Startups 8 Category:Tools Category is repeated and isn\u2019t\u00a0needed: grep -h \u0027Category:\u0027 **/*.md | sed \u0027s/[[:space:]]//g\u0027 | sort | uniq -c | sort | sed \u0027s/Category://g\u0027 This gives me the following output, which is\u00a0acceptable: 2 Data 2 Engineering 2 Front-end 6 8 Tools 15 General 15 Startups 16 Disintermediation New\u00a0Categories The next stage was to begin updating these categories with the new, nested categories. I\u2019ve decided to try splitting the categories into technical and non-technical\u00a0groups. I can imagine splitting Technical \u003e Data even more in future, perhaps having Data Analytics, Data Science, and Data Engineering as sub\u00a0categories. Technical Data Developer\u00a0Tools Web Cryptocurrency Civil\u00a0Engineering Not technical Entrepreneurship Family Self Career I cd into the directory containing the markdown files, and then to change all the articles with Category: Tools to Category: Technical/Developer Tools I\u00a0did: grep -l \u0027Category: Tools\u0027 *.md | xargs sed -i \u0027s/Category: Tools/Category: Technical\\/Developer Tools/g\u0027 If I want to see a list of files containing Category: General: grep -H \u0027Category: General\u0027 *.md If I want to see just the file names,\u00a0then: grep -l \u0027Category: General\u0027 *.md Update Since writing this post I\u2019ve modified the categories a few times. The commands I run to switch out categories are as\u00a0follows: export oldName=Lifestyle; export newName=Living grep -l \"Category: .*Non-technical/$oldName\" content/articles/*.md | xargs sed -i \u0027\u0027 \"s/Non-technical\\/$oldName/Non-technical\\/$newName/g\" Notes: Double quotes are not the same as single quotes. You need to use them if you want to access variables or commands inside a\u00a0string. .* is a wildcard operator allowing any number of characters. It\u2019s required when an article belongs to multiple\u00a0categories."

			"title": "A New Blog\u00a0Design",
			"category": "Technical/Web",
			"url": "a-new-blog-design.html",
			"date": "18 December 2020",
			"body": "The blog has a new design! Out with the old, and in with well-written HTML, an improved CSS framework, maintainable code, dark mode, and articles with multiple\u00a0categories. This website was my first ever project using HTML and CSS, and the codebase for the original blog was terrible. It was poorly written and hard to maintain. I remember when I was first building it and trying to figure out what a \u003cdiv\u003e or a \u003cspan\u003e really\u00a0was. At times I felt like little more than a monkey randomly bashing keys, hitting save and refreshing the browser tab. I felt guilty for spending any non-essential time away from my wife and daughter. I wondered if any benefits would actually materialize that would outweigh the costs of not rushing home to take care of a new-born and relieve a tired and stressed\u00a0mum. It took awhile, but eventually this blog became the most effective force multiplier I\u2019ve ever\u00a0used. As I\u2019ve learnt more about web development, the JAM stack has become increasingly intuitive and familiar. A side effect was that as I became comfortable with \u201cgood\u201d dev work, working with this blog\u2019s old code base became increasingly uncomfortable. I wanted to update the blog so that it would be easy and fun to use again. I want to be able to play with it quickly and\u00a0efficiently. I wasn\u2019t aiming for a radical re-design, I like that the focus is on text and I\u2019m not exploring any on-trend design choices. I think my original design choices have held up well. I want a design that will work for many years, with templates and code that is easy and intuitive to read, and design elements that are easier to work\u00a0with. I hope that I\u2019ll be writing here more regularly over the next few months. It\u2019s been a busy year and there is lots to write\u00a0about!"

			"category": "Non-technical/Entrepreneurship",

			"date": "8 December 2020",
 "tags": "marketing, startups ",			"body": "Part 1: Design your\u00a0strategy Chapter 1: Why is product-led growth of rising\u00a0importance? Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market (GTM) strategy that relies on using your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain\u00a0customers. Product-Led Growth (PLG) means that every team influences the product: Marketing - how can our products generate a demand\u00a0fly-wheel? Sales - how can we use the product to qualify our prospects for\u00a0us? Customer Success - how can we create a product that helps customers become successful beyond our\u00a0dreams? By having every team focussed on the product, you create a culture that is built around enduring customer\u00a0value By leading with the product throughout the org, PL companies get shorter sales\u00a0cycles lower Customer Acquisition Costs\u00a0(CACs) higher Revenue Per Employee (RPE) A GTM strategy is an action plan that specifies how a company will reach target customers and achieve a competitive\u00a0advantage In order to select a GTM, you first need to understand: market\u00a0conditions competitive\u00a0positioning ideal\u00a0customer product\u00a0offering Knowing these elements will help you choose the correct GTM that will acquire, retain and grow you customer base in the most capital-efficient\u00a0way Sales-Led Go-To-Market\u00a0Strategies Profit Centers: Sales, Marketing, Customer\u00a0Success Cost Centers: Engineering,\u00a0Product Advantages: Annual Contract Value (ACV) can be very\u00a0high Enterprise first solutions that are very complex and therefore need a high-touch sales\u00a0model If the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is very small, because your market is super niche, you can quite easily talk to almost all market participants. (PLG is built for large\u00a0TAMs) It\u2019s great for new categories of product where education is required, because you need to change how people approach a problem. This takes time and requires\u00a0education. This is turn requires that you understand your customers pain points, objections, core problems. If you jump to quickly a PLG GTM strategy then you risk a high church rate because you haven\u2019t understood or educated your customers well\u00a0enough. Disadvantages: Sales cycles are very\u00a0long The Life Time Value (LTV) must be high enough to recoup the investment in CAC. This often requires charging the customer a premium. This premium price isn\u2019t because the product is amazing, or more valuable to the customer, but because the customer acquisition model is more\u00a0expensive. If you use a Sales-Led GTM, you need to watch out for competitors who can sell more efficiently, or have a more efficient Customer Acquisition Model. They can steal your market share by offering the same product with at a lower\u00a0price. Customer Acquisition methods are super leaky. Most marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) never result in a closed deal, this is partly because: it encourages markets to gate content in order to hit their MQL\u00a0goals it focusses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent. (but reading a white-paper or brochure doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to buy the\u00a0thing). the entire process rewards creating friction in the buying\u00a0process Consequently, there is often a disconnect between marketing and\u00a0sales Product-Led Go-To-Market\u00a0Strategies Switching from Sales-Led GTM to Product-Led GTM creates a defensive\u00a0moat A product led marketing team asks \u201cHow can we use the product to qualify our prospects for\u00a0us?\u201d A product led customer success team asks \u201cHow can we create a product that helps customers be successful without our\u00a0help?\u201d A product-led engineering team asks \u201cHow can we create a product with a quick\u00a0time-to-value?\u201d Growth is much faster, because: you need fewer resources to\u00a0scale, the top of the customer funnel is much\u00a0wider. CAC is much\u00a0lower Higher RPE (revenue per\u00a0employee) User experience is\u00a0better Chapter 2 - Free, Freemium or\u00a0Demo Use the MOAT framework to pick the right GTM\u00a0strategy: Market Strategy - Dominant? Disruptive?\u00a0Differentiated? Ocean Conditions - Blue or\u00a0Red? Audience - Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing\u00a0strategy? Time to Value - How much time do you need for a customer to experience the\u00a0value? Dominant - Do it better than the competition and charge a lower\u00a0price Is your TAM big\u00a0enough? Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at lower cost than anyone else on the\u00a0market? Can the user realize significant ongoing value quickly with little or no\u00a0help? Do you want to be the undisputed market\u00a0leader? Differentiated - Pick and win a fight against an industry giant Main line of defense against the giant is\u00a0specialization Focus on an underserved\u00a0niche Do a specific job better than the competition but charge significantly\u00a0more This is not a one-size-fits-all\u00a0model. Free trials and demos work well\u00a0here. Because its specialized, combining freemium with quick time-to-value is\u00a0difficult Main competitive advantage is how you solve your customers\u00a0problems Does your market have underserved\u00a0customers? Is the TAM big\u00a0enough? is the ACV high\u00a0enough? Could prospects experience a Magic Moment during a free\u00a0trial? Disruptive - Charge less for an inferior product (e.g. Canva, Google docs) Build a simpler product that solves a specific pain point, and because its simpler, its faster, you can charge less, and its more appropriate to some over-served or priced-out\u00a0customers It\u2019s a scaled-down\u00a0product Costs must be\u00a0low Product must be easy to\u00a0use Is TAM large\u00a0enough? Can on-boarding be completely\u00a0self-service? Freemium model\u00a0thrives Chapter 3 - Red-Ocean or Blue-Ocean\u00a0markets? Red-ocean companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a larger share of the existing market. As the market gets crowded, opportunity for profit and growth reduces. Products become commodities. Cut-throat competition turns the waters\u00a0red. Blue-ocean companies access untapped market space and create demand. They have opportunity for highly profitable growth. Competition is irrelevant. Create and capture new\u00a0demand. Some markets will be red-ocean, but a particular niche within it will be blue\u00a0ocean. Blue Oceans require educating the customer to create the demand. This is high-touch, and often a PL GTM strategy isn\u2019t going to work. It needs to be sales-led in order to educate the customer enough. But if Time-To-Value (TTV) is short then PLG could be\u00a0great. Red Oceans need big wide funnels in order to compete, and PL GTM strategies work great. They\u2019re defensible, keep costs low and make sales cycles\u00a0short. Chapter 4 - Top-Down or Bottom-Up selling\u00a0strategy? PLG works for\u00a0bottom-up. High touch sales-led strategies work for Top-Down enterprise sales strategies, where the product is super complex and the sales cyccle is very\u00a0long. Top-Down (Sales team is the growth\u00a0engine): High ACV Additional\u00a0Services Lower customer\u00a0churn Poor revenue\u00a0distribution High CAC Long sales\u00a0cycles Free Trial sometimes\u00a0works Bottom-Up (Product is the growth\u00a0engine): Wider\u00a0top-of-funnel Low CAC Predictable sales\u00a0figures Revenue\u00a0diversity Scalable\u00a0fast Small contracts\u00a0only non-paying\u00a0customers expertise\u00a0shortage upfront investment as non-paying customers drain\u00a0resources Freemium Free-Trial Chapter 5 -\u00a0Time-to-Value How much time until you deliver on your promise to\u00a0prospects? How much time until the product sells\u00a0itself? PL GTM strategies require fast\u00a0time-to-value. Rank your uses across 2 dimensions and group into 4 quadrants. The dimensions are Ability (low - high) and Motivation (low - high) Low Motivation - Low Ability = Mission\u00a0Impossible High Motivation - Low Ability =\u00a0Rookie Low Motivation - High Ability =\u00a0Veteran High Motivation - High Ability =\u00a0Spoiled Figure out your top two quadrants. Unless all your users are Spoiled, you need to decrease\u00a0Time-To-Value. Questions: How motivated are your\u00a0users? Is your product easy for your target audience to\u00a0use? Can users experience the core value (magic moment?) without\u00a0hand-holding? Part 2 - Build Your\u00a0Foundation Chapter 7 - Build a product-led\u00a0foundation A positive feedback\u00a0loop: Understand your\u00a0value Communicate\u00a0it Deliver on your\u00a0promise Repeat Chapter 8 - Understand your\u00a0value If you\u2019re selling live-chat software, you\u2019re not really selling live-chat software, you are selling a new and better way to acquire\u00a0customers. You are selling the outcome, the result, the\u00a0why. Pain makes us want to change so that we can avoid or prevent the pain\u00a0altogether. Pain is product\u00a0agnostic. There are three reasons why people buy a\u00a0product: Functional Outcome - the core task that needs to get\u00a0done. Emotional Outcome - how a customer wants to feel or avoid feeling as a result of the functional\u00a0outcome. Social Outcome - how a customer wants to be perceived by others by using your\u00a0product. In every software, there are usage patterns that point towards to core outcomes that are most important to\u00a0customers. One of the biggest differences between sales-led and product-led companies is that SL companies monitor usage patters to see if users are accomplishing meaningful outcomes. These outcomes are referred to as value-metrics. A value-metric is the way you measure value exchange in your product. They are the linchpin to successful execution of a product-led GTM strategy because you are aligning your revenue model directly with your customer acquisition model. Because your value metrics play a vital role in how you price your product, set up your monitoring, and build your\u00a0team. Value metrics could\u00a0be: for Vimeo, number of videos uploaded by the\u00a0user. for Slack, number of messages sent by the\u00a0user for PayPal, amount of revenue generated by the user\u00a0(processed?) There are functional and outcome based value metrics. Functional value metrics are \u201cper user\u201d or \u201cper 100 videos\u201d. Pricing scales around functions of usage. Outcome based value metrics charge based on the outcome, e.g. how many views a video received, or how much money a customer made when using your payment process\u00a0method. Many SaaS companies rely on feature differentiation as a way to justify higher prices, but this produces higher\u00a0churn. Value metrics outperform feature differentiation with upto 75% less\u00a0churn\u2026 Outcome based value metrics reduce church by an additional 40%.\u00a0Apparently. A good value metric is easy for a customer to understand. They need to immediately understand what they\u2019re paying for and where they fit in your packing/pricing structure. If you\u2019re in an established market, it makes senses to look at what the competition\u00a0charges. A good value metric is aligned with the value that the customer receives through the product. Consider the low-level components of your high-level outcome. E.g. what low level actions are necessary to get the end result? Sending lots of messages? Meeting lots of people? Finding lots of\u00a0things? A good value metric grows with your customers usage of the valuable outcome. If customers get incredible value from the product, charge them more because the product is worth it. Also, if they aren\u2019t getting much value from the product, charge them\u00a0less. Don\u2019t do user based pricing if you want to get lots of users - its a conflict of\u00a0interests. If you\u2019re small, you can try different pricing strategies and iterate to\u00a0success. Ask\u00a0yourself: What do my best customers\u00a0do? What do my best customers not\u00a0do? What features did my best customers try first when they were\u00a0on-boarding? What are the similarities along my best customers that led to\u00a0success? For churned customers, what were the main differences between them and the best customers? Were they in the ideal audience? Why did they church? What did they do or not do that good customers\u00a0didn\u2019t?"

Focus on the right, tight, customer\u00a0segment. Prep well, take good notes, review your\u00a0notes. Table of Contents Summary Chapter 1 - Opinions are\u00a0worthless Chapter 2 - Avoid bad\u00a0data Chapter 3 - Ask the important\u00a0questions Chapter 4 - Keep it\u00a0casual Chapter 5 - The currencies of\u00a0conversation Chapter 6 - Finding good\u00a0conversations Chapter 7 - Choosing you\u00a0customers Chapter 8 - Getting the most from the conversations by prepping and\u00a0reviewing Chapter 1 - Opinions are\u00a0worthless Anything involving the future is an overly optimistic lie. You want objective facts about what happened in the\u00a0past. Find out if people care about your idea by never mentioning\u00a0it. Forcing yourself not to mention your idea will force you to ask better\u00a0questions Make sure your questions pass the mom test: Talk about their lives, not your\u00a0idea. Ask about specific objective events in the past, not hypothetical\u00a0scenarios. Spend most of your time listening, not\u00a0talking. Chapter 2 - Avoid bad\u00a0data You aren\u2019t allowed to tell them what their problem\u00a0is. They aren\u2019t allowed to tell you what to\u00a0build. Bad data\u00a0includes: Compliments Fluff Hypotheticals Ideas Chapter 3 - Ask the important\u00a0questions You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you ask in each\u00a0conversation. Search out the scary questions you\u2019ve been unintentionally avoiding. What\u2019s the worst thing a prospect could say? What\u2019s the scariest question you could\u00a0ask? A good way to find scary questions is to imagine that your company has failed and then to ask\u00a0why. If you get an unexpected answer to one of your questions and it doesn\u2019t have any effect on what you\u2019re going to do, then was it really worth asking\u00a0it? General advice for hard things includes asking hard questions. Imagine you were delegating the task, what would you tell the person to do? That\u2019s\u00a0you. You can ask about\u00a0money. Love bad news - if you find out that your idea is fundamentally flawed you\u2019ve just saved a tonne of time and energy and money. Move on. It\u2019s getting you closer to the\u00a0truth. Bad news isn\u2019t the result of an opinion. No one knows if your idea will work, only the market\u00a0knows. Opinions don\u2019t\u00a0count. A lukewarm response to your idea can be a great conversation, because you realise that your idea isn\u2019t a great idea. Lukewarm means they don\u2019t care enough to buy the first (worst) version before it\u2019s\u00a0ready. Look before you zoom. Don\u2019t focus on details too soon, you need to understand the big picture\u00a0first. You have product risk and customer risk: Product risk - can I build it and grow\u00a0it? Customer risk - is there a big enough group of people who are going to buy\u00a0it? Pre-plan a list of the 3 most important questions (including a scary one) before every meeting or conversation. Be ready with these. They should change from week to week. As you get good quality answers to existing questions you can bring in new\u00a0questions. Chapter 4 - Keep it\u00a0casual Problem -\u003e Solution -\u003e\u00a0Sales Normally you would have 3 meetings with a client when you make a big sale. This lets you do each stage really well without blurring the data: Identify your prospect\u2019s\u00a0problem Explain your\u00a0solution Sell the\u00a0solution Identifying a problem doesn\u2019t have to be a meeting, keep it casual and you will get more honest feedback much faster. It works better as a chat when people are relaxed and saying what they really\u00a0think. It take 5 minutes (max) to identify if a problem exists and is\u00a0important. Give as little info as possible about your idea whilst still nudging the conversation\u00a0along Chapter 5 - The currencies of\u00a0conversation In early stage sales, the main goal is learning. Money is a\u00a0side-effect. Will they spend money, time, or reputation on your\u00a0solution? If someone is willing to risk reputation, or spend time or money on your idea, then you can believe that they\u2019re\u00a0interested. Hearing a compliment means they\u2019re trying to get rid of\u00a0you. If it\u2019s a bad meeting or you\u2019re not sure what they really think, push for a commitment of some kind. Ask them to spend time, reputation or money and you\u2019ll see what they really\u00a0think. If they aren\u2019t excited (not just interested, but in pain and excited for your solution) then you need to find that out ASAP. It\u2019s still a good meeting if you can discover\u00a0this. Are you offering pain relief\u00a0medication? A lead isn\u2019t a real lead until you\u2019ve given them a concrete chance to reject\u00a0you. Ask learning questions by using the Mom Test, then confirm by selling\u00a0it. You need crazy customers: They have a painful and expensive\u00a0problem They know they have a painful and expensive\u00a0problem They have the money to pay you to solve\u00a0it They already have their own bad solution to this terrible problem, and yours is clearly\u00a0better A crazy customer doesn\u2019t say \u201cyeah that\u2019s great, I\u2019m really interested, let me know when its ready\u201d. They say \u201cAHHH THIS IS THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE AND I WILL PAY YOU RIGHT NOW TO FIX IT!\u201d A crazy customer will front you the money when all you have is a barely functional prototype made of\u00a0duct-tape A crazy customer is the person reading you blog, searching for workarounds, when you haven\u2019t spent loads of marketing and lead\u00a0generation Keep a crazy customer close - they\u2019ll stick with you when times are\u00a0tough. Chapter 6 - Finding good\u00a0conversations Vision -\u003e Framing -\u003e Weakness -\u003e Pedestal -\u003e\u00a0Ask Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new\u00a0stuff. If it\u2019s a topic you both care about, find an excuse. You\u2019ll both enjoy the chat. You don\u2019t need to mention your idea if it breaks the\u00a0premise. Warm introductions are the ideal way to start a new conversation. 6 degrees of freedom in the world, so find someone who knows someone who knows\u00a0them. Cold calls - LinkedIn,\u00a0maybe. Serendipity - be prepared, be\u00a0bold. Have a good excuse -\u00a0hustle. Landing pages - so that googling the problems brings them to\u00a0you. Organise an event - bring the businesses together for an event. You\u2019ll be considered an expert because you\u2019re facilitating\u00a0it. Become a subject matter\u00a0expert Speaking and teaching engagements - you get to have strong opinions, and you\u2019ll be\u00a0respected. Chapter 7 - Choosing you\u00a0customers Startups don\u2019t starve, they drown. In options, choices, ideas. You get\u00a0overwhelmed. Choose a good customer segment, focus on it, and don\u2019t get\u00a0distracted. In the beginning: Google - PhD\u00a0students. PayPal -\u00a0eBay. Evernote - Moms with\u00a0recipes. It will look obvious with hindsight, probably not so obvious before you\u2019ve figured it\u00a0out. If you can\u2019t get a consistent answer to a question, maybe you\u2019re speaking to different\u00a0segments. If you aren\u2019t finding consistent problems and goals then you don\u2019t have a specific enough customer segment. Within the group, which type of person would want it the\u00a0most? Would everyone within the group want to buy/use it? Or only\u00a0some? Why does the subset want\u00a0it? Does everyone in the group have the same\u00a0motivation? What other motivations are\u00a0there? Who else (outside the group) has these\u00a0motivations? Go for Who-Where pairs of segments. \u201cFinance professionals who run\u00a0marathons\u201d.. You want customers who are reachable, profitable, and personally\u00a0rewarding. Good segments are usually \u201cwho-where\u201d pairs. If you don\u2019t know where to find your customers, keep slicing until you do. Make sure the segment is reachable, profitable, and personally\u00a0rewarding Chapter 8 - Getting the most from the conversations by prepping and\u00a0reviewing Prepare\u00a0well Have your three big questions ready, including the scary\u00a0ones. Know who you are speaking\u00a0to. Know what commitment and next-steps you want to push\u00a0for. Spend up to an hour writing\u00a0down: Your best guesses about what you think they\u2019ll\u00a0say. What they care\u00a0about. What they\u00a0want. If you have a focussed segment, you\u2019ll only need to do this\u00a0occasionally. If you come across a question which can be answered using the internet, use the\u00a0internet. Take good\u00a0notes Ask if you can record the\u00a0audio. Record emotions as well as words. Verbatim alone isn\u2019t always accurate 6 months\u00a0later. Use shorthand for follow\u00a0up. Observe and record emotions - happy, angry, meh,\u00a0etc. Pains and obstacles are a lot more important if someone is embarrassed or angry when they\u2019re talking about\u00a0them. Dig into the big emotions, find out what\u2019s causing them, or why its a big\u00a0deal. Review your notes Meta - which questions went well or\u00a0not? What were the answers to the scary\u00a0questions? How can you do better next\u00a0time? What were the clear signals? What signals did you\u00a0miss?"

It might hide your key strengths or misunderstand your\u00a0value. Find people to demo your product to, then ask them to describe it back to you. Do the same with existing customers. If they\u2019re not saying the same thing then you have a positioning\u00a0problem. Products with strong positioning: Find the best kind of\u00a0customer Make the value\u00a0obvious Sell\u00a0quickly Part\u00a01 Positioning as\u00a0context Without positioning to guide us, we don\u2019t know how to understnad a\u00a0product Positioning lets us make assumptions about who a product is\u00a0for what its main features\u00a0are how much it\u00a0costs Without it we would be paralyzed by choice, and we wouldnt be able to make sense of all the products around\u00a0us. The context and purpose of a product from the founders/engineers perspective are often different to those of the\u00a0prospect Products can be positioned in multiple ways, and often the best positioning is not the default\u00a0positioning Bad positioning makes it harder for prospects to figure out if your product is worth thinking\u00a0about. Positioning requires considering: Customers point of view - what problem/pain does it\u00a0solve The ways your product is uniquely\u00a0different The characteristics of a potential\u00a0customer The best market context to make your value uniquely\u00a0obvious Five (plus one) components of effective\u00a0positioning Competitive Alternatives - if you didn\u2019t exist, what would your customers use instead? Its what your prospects would use to do the task if your product didn\u2019t exist. It could be excel, or pen and paper. It could be nothing, (in which case maybe you product doesn\u2019t solve a real pain\u00a0point.) You probably know a lot more about your market, and problem, and alternative solutions, than your prospects do. (\u201cDoing nothing\u201d could be an opportunity, not a red\u00a0flag.) Its important to understand what customers will compare your product with, because this is how they will define \u201cbetter\u201d. Is it \u201ceasier\u201d than a pen and\u00a0paper? Customers might never have purchased a solution like yours\u00a0before. Unique Attributes - What do you have that alternative do not? Could be: Delivery Model (online vs offline, installed on-site vs\u00a0not) Business model (rental vs\u00a0purchase) Specific expertise (data scientist with financial and back-end web dev\u00a0expertise) Value (and quantifiable objective proof) - What value do the attributes enable for customers? If unique attributes are your secret sauce, the value is why someone might care about your secret\u00a0sauce Fact based, provable, demonstrable, quantifiable, objective. Third party opinions are\u00a0relevant. Target market characteristics - Who cares a lot about that value? Focus on customers who are most likely to purchase quickly, wont ask for discounts, will tell their friends about\u00a0you. You should clearly identify who these are\u00a0and Identity what sets them apart from other groups of customers. Why are they uniquely likely to buy from you when others wouldnt or would take longer to consider and make a\u00a0purchase Market Category - What context makes your value obvious to the ideal customer? Declaring that your product exists in a certain market triggers a powerful set of\u00a0assumptions make these assumptions help you, not hinder\u00a0you. When presented with your product, customers will try to use what they already know to figure out what your product is all about and why its special. You want them to be able to do this really quickly and\u00a0easily. Make these assumptions work for you, not against you. You won\u2019t have to list every feature, because most of them will be assumed by the context of the market\u00a0category. Get it right, and sales efforts (copy) wont be wasted battling those assumptions, but can instead build off of them to show secret sauce and value more\u00a0obviously. (Bonus) Relevant Trends - what trends make your product relevant right now? Used carefully, trends can show prospoects why they should pay attention to your product right now. Increases\u00a0urgency. It can increase urgency, excitement, coolness,\u00a0credibility but the trend must be directly relevant, practically and objectively\u00a0applicable. Blockchains, AI, ML are trends - they are relevant to multiple\u00a0markets. Each of these components is relevant to the\u00a0others"

It still is difficult, but I now have a collection of tools and perspectives that make it less daunting. Leveling up requires one more abstraction to wrap my head around, or one more API to understand. I can do\u00a0it. But I don\u2019t think it needed to be so difficult, so now I\u2019m building Code School Meta to make it easier to learn how to\u00a0code. Learning to code has been fun, ultimately successful, and life changing (hello job security!) but at the beginning it was sooo slow, and super\u00a0tricky. Imposter syndrome is real, and I definitely felt it. I hadn\u2019t taken any classes in computer science, and I felt like I knew almost nothing about\u00a0anything. The process began with Pandas, a (the) Python analytics library. Spreadsheets were slowing me down at work, and I was bored. I found this great tutorial by Brandon Rhodes. From there I found out about Jupyter Notebooks, and then I found about Github pages and how to make a blog using pelican. That led to HTML and CSS (and also JavaScript, which I tried very hard to avoid for as long as possible). I felt like a monkey bashing a keyboard as I tried to make HTML elements do what I\u00a0wanted. Unusally, I think Git was next. Mainly because I found this amazing tutorial to help me learn. It made Git seem OK, and also helped HTML and CSS make more sense too.\u00a0Bonus! I suddenly realized that great learning materials are crucial if I was going to keep momentum and keep on enjoying the thrill of seeing the computer do something I hadn\u2019t made it do\u00a0before. So now I\u2019m now working on Code School: Meta. It\u2019s an online community to make it easier to teach yourself how to code - less confusion about how to get started or what to learn next, more encouragement, and lots of high quality\u00a0resources.

I\u2019ve challenged myself to build something useful enough that customers would want to pay for it and in the process of seeking that goal I\u2019ve become a much better and more rounded\u00a0developer. I\u2019ve been working solo for about 7 months now, and in that time I\u2019ve begun using test driven development, I\u2019ve built non-trivial data driven web apps using Django, and I\u2019ve learnt how to deploy and monitor those apps in production and make them\u00a0performant. I\u2019ve made two main apps; moneybar.nl and pippip.email, and I\u2019ve learnt so\u00a0much. I\u2019m realising though, that I still have much to learn in other spheres. Being a great developer is deeply meaningful to me. It\u2019s literally a bucket list item for me and I intend to be writing code as long as I live. But there is no point creating products if no one knows they\u00a0exist. This is where marketing and positioning comes in. Right now it feels like I know nothing about how to get users, or validate an idea, or position a product. These are all super necessary and super\u00a0unknown. On a more meta level, I\u2019m confronted with the lost benefits of working with co-founders, or of having friends doing similar things. I want to work faster and make progress more efficiently. I need to be part of a\u00a0community. Working in isolation does have its advantages, though. I\u2019m self-taught and self-directed, figuring out the contours of uncharted territory and creating my own personal map. In my mind, I have a deep and almost personal relationship with the coding abstractions and tools I\u2019ve learnt to work with. Classes and functions, strings and floats, literally have (to me) their own textures, colors and weights when I think or dream about\u00a0them. It feels like I can pick up these abstractions as if they were physical objects and turn them around to examine them. Place them next to each other and compare the differences. Run thought experiements. In my experience, this kind of relationship and affection simply doesn\u2019t happen when taking a class or following someone elses schedule. It\u2019s satisying to feel ownership of a skill like this, and it\u2019s one of the primary reasons I consider coding to be similar to a\u00a0craft. Having said all that, now that I realise I need to validate my product, position it, and figure out marketing, I\u2019ve stopped writing code, put down my tools, and I\u2019m going to learn marketing. I\u2019ve bought some books. Maybe I\u2019ll post some reviews here\u00a0later. In no particular order here is what I plan to\u00a0read: The 1-Page marketing plan, by Allan Dib Obviously Awesome, by April\u00a0Dunford Lean Analytics, Hooked, How to build habit-forming products, by Nir Eyal\u00a0The Mom Test, by Rob\u00a0Fitzpatrick This is marketing, by Seth\u00a0Godin Product-led growth, by Wes\u00a0Bush I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve covered 90% of the distance required or 50%.

(but without useful tools and plugins): Now that I can measure how long it takes to start, it would be useful to know which proccesses are causing the greatest delays. This could be done with something like zsh -xv which enables verbose output and xtrace. This creates a tonne of output, but doesnt inlcude timestamps.

The most interesting solution to this problem is the Lightning protocol - a separate protocol that sits ontop of the Bitcoin protocol (a so-called \u2018Layer 2\u2019 solution). Lightning uses hashed time locked contracts (HTLCs) to trustlessly and privately move transactions off-chain. This allows payments to be faster, cheaper and more frequent. It also has interesting implications for enhancing\u00a0privacy. There are a lot of resources about what the Lightning network is, why it\u2019s neccesary and how it works. There are also several good guides available about how to set up and maintain a node. I used a Raspberry Pi with an external hdd.

			"date": "7 June 2018",
 "tags": "gnosis, prediction, markets, brexit, betting ",			"body": "Predicting port traffic using prediction\u00a0markets Background A prediction market allows people to bet on an unknown future event. For example, \u201cWhat will the Euro-Dollar exchange rate be on date\u00a0X?\u201d. In several common forecasting scenarios, prediction markets have been more accurate than polls, expert opinions, and statistical methods1 and therefore prediction models are useful for observers (anybody who is interested in the outcome) and not just the market\u2019s participants. Prediction markets can be used for categorical events (a specific event that either does or doesn\u2019t happen) or scalar events (when the outcome is between a range of values). The predefined source of truth for the outcomes being predicted is called an\u00a0Oracle. Prediction markets enables participants to purchase shares or tokens tied to the outcome of a specific future event. Once the event has occurred, holders of the tokens representing the actual outcome will receive a reward of predefined value. This creates an incentive to hold tokens corresponding to the correct outcome, and the market dynamics of supply and demand allow the price to reflect perceived probabilities of different outcomes. Helpfully, the price of each type of token corresponds to the relative probability of each outcome occurring which allows for simple interpretation of the results. If the reward for holding a share corresponding to the correct outcome is $1, and the present price of this share is 50 cents, then the market\u2019s estimate of the likelihood of this outcome occurring is\u00a050%. Shares can be traded continuously. As trading occurs over time the probability of different outcomes will change as new information becomes known, and the changing price of the shares quantify\u00a0this. An\u00a0example Let\u2019s describe how this could work with an\u00a0example: There is a large degree of uncertainty2 around how Britain will continue to trade with the other European countries when it exits the EU on March 29, 2019. A prediction market will likely be a better predictor of the outcome than any other\u00a0method. If an adequate agreement isn\u2019t achieved, Britain\u2019s main port at Dover will certainly experience long delays and large traffic jams. Therefore a prediction market asking \u201cHow many vehicles will be admitted into Britain at the port of Dover between 00:00 and 23:59 on March 29 2019?\u201d will give a useful prediction about the outcome of Britain\u2019s trade negotiations - a key component and sticking point in the Brexit\u00a0negotiations. Each type of token in the prediction market will correspond to different quantities of vehicles entering the port3 - for example there could be four (or more) categories; Less than 8000, between 8000 and 11000, between 11000 and 14000, and more than 14000. The relative price of a share in each category will correspond to the relative probabilities of each possible\u00a0outcome. If the number of vehicles is lower than would otherwise be expected, (around 12000) this would likely be due to the impact of Brexit and thus the market will serve as a useful proxy for predicting what kind of Brexit will\u00a0occur. Stakeholder incentives are\u00a0aligned One reason that prediction markets work so well is because they aggregate information from disparate sources and the price shows not only an impartial assessment of the most likely outcome but the aggregated level of confidence that the participants have. Since no one is obliged to participate, those that do believe they have valuable information which gives them a competitive advantage. This creates a mechanism that moves good quality information into the prediction market, with the resulting prices reflecting the probability of a range of\u00a0outcomes. In our example, people with relevant information would include port employees, business owners in the UK and in Europe, politicians, civil servants, business analysts, bankers, etc. Whilst it is clear that any of these roles may have useful information or judgement about the outcome, it is not clear how useful each participants role is relative to the others. By allowing a participant to bid for as many shares in as many different categories as they want, each participant\u2019s confidence in their information can be\u00a0quantified. In this way, prediction markets align the incentives of market participants and observers. If the market is large enough then it becomes prohibitively expensive to distort the market and promote poor quality information, including information designed to create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), fake news, or alternative\u00a0facts. Market\u00a0providers Prediction markets are nothing new, with political betting being used to make predictions as early as the 1500s. However the adoption of the internet and decentralised networks now allow prediction markets to be used more widely and cheaply than ever before. Gnosis is building a platform on the Ethereum blockchain on which others can build new applications which harness the power of prediction\u00a0markets. By lowering the cost and complexity of creating a prediction market, observers can benefit from high quality and impartial predictive information about future events, and market participants are rewarded for accurate assessments of likely outcomes. This will enable better decision making and empower observers with previously unobtainable insight. In our example, the market could be created and funded by any organisation that would benefit from knowing the results of the prediction market. This could be the port of Dover itself, news organisations, or market research firms. Any of these businesses would benefit from an accurate\u00a0prediction. K. J. Arrow, R. Forsythe, M. Gorham, R.

It\u2019s free, robust, comprehensive, and there is a plethora of resources that are easy to\u00a0find. I usually find the commands difficult to remember though, and the concepts which Git is built on often seem counter-intuitive to me. This means I spend a lot of time searching for answers and trying to remember how I can use Git to experiment with a project without fear of losing any hard won\u00a0progress. Ry\u2019s Git Tutorial by Ryan Hodson is the best way to learn Git that I have come across. Its simple, practical, and clear. The reader learns how to use Git by creating and maintaining a simple website. This gives the Git commands a meaningful context, which makes them a lot easier to remember and use in the\u00a0future. The tutorial was first published in 2012 and the website which originally hosted the examples no longer exists. Each tutorial chapter starts with a link to download the project files up to that point, so the reader doesn\u2019t need to start at the beginning but can jump into any part of the\u00a0guide. Unfortunately these links no longer work. Therefore I\u2019m going to make the materials available here so that they can continue to be useful. If the author would like to get in touch, please do. I\u2019d like to keep this great resource available so that others can benefit from\u00a0it. .epub or .pdf versions are available to\u00a0download.

			"title": "How to buy\u00a0Bitcoin",
			"category": "Technical/Cryptocurrencies",
			"url": "buying-btc.html",
			"date": "7 December 2017",
 "tags": "bitcoin ",			"body": "Recently a few friends have asked me how they can buy Bitcoin. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, but here are a few things that come to\u00a0mind: Don\u2019t invest what you can\u2019t afford to\u00a0lose. If the price falls 50%, you need to be able to wait whilst the price\u00a0recovers. Write down the\u00a0following: How much can you afford to invest? Consider how much cash you will need over the next year, how long it would take to recover any losses,\u00a0etc. How long do you want to invest\u00a0for? How much profit do you want to make? Don\u2019t have an open-ended\u00a0goal. You will need to get good at identifying and ignoring the following, even from your\u00a0friends: Hype Fake\u00a0news Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD) Don\u2019t trust without\u00a0verifying. The previous point is really important, and also\u00a0difficult. By putting something you care about in a risky situation (it is risky) you will experience anxiety and excitement. You need to control your psychology and identity when other people are trying to manipulate you. This is useful in all areas of\u00a0life. Investing is good mental exercise because money has an intensely psychological quality about it, and crypto currencies are the most intense trading experience there is right\u00a0now. Almost no one has a clue what\u2019s happening. Conventional economists and traders certainly don\u2019t. This is crypto-economics and the rules haven\u2019t been worked out yet. We\u2019ve never had this tech before, and the internet has made everything - communication and innovation - much quicker. This is a powerful combination of factors and we haven\u2019t seen them play out\u00a0before. Take some time to read about the fundamentals and understand the tech as much as you can. Think about why people would behave in certain ways and what makes bitcoin useful, or not. Get started on this today, it will take some\u00a0time. YouTube has a tonne of videos, and these two sites are good and detailed: lopp.net namamotoinstitute.org Twitter has a lot of current and new information, but also a lot of bots and scammers spreading hype and FUD (see point\u00a04). If you\u2019re going to lose sleep over your investment, invest\u00a0less. Don\u2019t buy at an all time high. Do your research, wait for the price to correct. Prices fall. The chart at the top of the page shows the 20 day and 55 day moving average compared to the daily price. My opinion is that by early January the price will have returned to between the 20 day and 55 day average before beginning to rise\u00a0again. Coinbase is a user friendly and reputable exchange, there are other good exchanges\u00a0too. Don\u2019t make financial decisions when you\u2019re feeling rushed. Check your\u00a0psychology. If you\u2019ve bought some Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, don\u2019t store them on an exchange. Transfer them to a wallet that you control. If you don\u2019t own your private key, you don\u2019t own the asset. If you don\u2019t know what that means, google it (Point\u00a08)."

 "tags": "bitnation, pangea ",			"body": "The\u00a0problem In many countries the ability to create legally binding agreements is not available to average citizens. Legal services are often unaffordable and opaque, or service providers are corrupt. Legal services are in need of\u00a0disruption. The\u00a0solution Pangea Bitnation (who I consult for) intends to address this problem by empowering people to self-organise and self-govern. We are building a platform called Pangea which allows users to create, notarise and arbitrate contracts according to a jurisdiction which each party joins voluntarily, irrespective of their geographical\u00a0location. Pangea is a smart phone app that looks and feels like a chat app, the back-end (called Panthalassa) is an encrypted mesh network hooked up to the Ethereum\u00a0blockchain. Rewarded for doing good, empowered to be a responsible\u00a0citizen On Pangea, people are incentivised to be good citizens by receiving rewards for doing good, rather than being coerced by the threat of punishment for bad\u00a0behaviour. This platform would fulfil a vast and unmet need, particularly in countries whose legal systems function poorly. On Pangea, a user voluntarily chooses which jurisdiction to be a part of. Contracts are then notarised, executed and arbitrated according to that jurisdiction. Users voluntarily join a decentralised borderless voluntary nation (DBVN) and will receive tokens (Pangea Arbitration Tokens) as a reward for good behaviour. The tokens will be tradable and will be used as payment on Pangea for notarisation and arbitration\u00a0services. Combining a store of value and access to legal\u00a0services Societies cannot escape their need to use currency as stores of value. They also cannot escape their need to create reliable and enforceable agreements (contracts) with each\u00a0other. Generating Bitcoin through proof of work occurs because individuals believe that Bitcoin will be continuously used \u2014 that it will meet an ongoing need to transact using a decentralised and disintermediated\u00a0method. Generating PAT by being a good citizen will occur because individuals believe that Pangea will be continuously used \u2014 that it will meet an ongoing need to create enforceable agreements using a voluntary and geographically agnostic (and decentralised)\u00a0method. Comments There is much still to say about the Pangea platform and the mechanisms which will make it function. Please give feedback and ask questions in the comments.

			"title": "Bitcoin compared to\u00a0gold",
			"category": "Technical/Cryptocurrencies",
			"url": "bitcoin-vs-gold.html",
			"date": "21 November 2017",
 "tags": "bitcoin, gold, safe haven ",			"body": "A safe haven asset is something to buy during economic uncertainty. Historically, the safest asset you can buy has been gold. This is not because of anything inherently special about gold, but because that is what people believe to be the best long term method of storing\u00a0value. People believe gold is special because they assume that in future other people will believe it\u2019s\u00a0special. Criteria for a safe haven\u00a0asset A safe-haven asset must fulfil the following\u00a0criteria: Price isn\u2019t controlled by any single party, including a state or bank. The market is spread out beyond the reach of any one organisation. This is important because an asset which is issued, controlled or backed by an organisation has its value tied to the health of that\u00a0organisation. Supply isn\u2019t controlled by any single party, including a state, bank or anyone else - it exists naturally and the rate at which it\u2019s produced or traded is beyond the control of any one\u00a0organisation. Supply is limited. The effort required to create the asset naturally limits the\u00a0supply. The asset doesn\u2019t wear out or\u00a0expire. It\u2019s prohibitively expensive to\u00a0fake. Almost everyone considers it to be precious and\u00a0valuable. It can be stored and transported simply. It\u2019s not delicate or\u00a0volatile. For these reasons, and because of historical consensus, people have been happy to use gold as a store of value in times of economic uncertainty or for long durations. Other assets also meets these requirements to lesser\u00a0extents. Bitcoin compared to\u00a0gold Consider why gold is so good as a safe haven asset and long term value store. For all the reasons above, bitcoin is better, except one: At present, not many people consider it to be precious and valuable, so the market is small. This will change as confidence and awareness increases, and the eco-system of services and applications\u00a0matures. The fundamentals are already\u00a0established: A decentralised network ensures that Bitcoin can\u2019t be regulated or manipulated by any single government or organisation. The Bitcoin network can\u2019t be turned\u00a0off. The present and future rate of supply is publicly available and unchangeable. This increases market efficiency and creates more rational pricing than a market where the rate of supply is\u00a0unverifiable. Supply is naturally (mathematically) limited using proof of work\u00a0algorithms. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t corrode or wear\u00a0out. Bitcoin is impossible to\u00a0fake. Bitcoin can be stored and transported more easily than gold. - If you can remember 24 words then you can access your bitcoin for free from any internet\u00a0connection. Read\u00a0more This article, published a week after I wrote this post, looks at different factors to consider when evaluating Bitcoin\u2019s value. It goes into a lot of detail, relative to what I\u2019ve seen in other\u00a0articles."

 "tags": "wallet, crypto, blockchain, bitcoin ",			"body": "What is a hardware\u00a0wallet A hardware wallet (HW wallet) is a physical device that stores the information required to access digital currency or assets. It is plugged into a computer via USB in order to initiate or confirm transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other digital asset blockchain\u00a0networks. They are a secure method of storing cryptographic data. They are so secure that they can be used on a compromised computer. All that is needed to access funds using a HW wallet (in addition to the device itself) is a PIN code which the user chooses. A single HW wallet can store multiple currencies in multiple\u00a0accounts. HW wallets are an easier solution than remembering a good password, and safer than storing the data in a file on my computer or\u00a0online. The best known hardware wallet brands are Ledger and Trezor. The\u00a0problem HW wallets are technically great, but their size and shape creates a bad user experience. A good hardware wallet should be convenient to use multiple times each day, like a credit card\u00a0is. Current hardware wallets don\u2019t fit into a (money) wallet and people don\u2019t want to carry more any objects in their pockets. They are too big and are a bad\u00a0shape. HW wallets look like they might belong on a keyring, but it\u2019s inconvenient and insecure to attach a credit card to a keyring and the same is true for an HW wallet. I might store my keys on a hook by my door, but I would never leave my wallet there overnight. I often want to keep my keys and money separate because I need my keys when I\u2019m near my house, where I don\u2019t need to buy stuff, and I need my money when I\u2019m away from my house where I don\u2019t need to unlock\u00a0anything. I want to keep my bank cards and cash together in one safe place, and I don\u2019t want to carry around a dongle as well. It\u2019s\u00a0inconvenient. It\u2019s easier to have a separate dongle lost or stolen than something that would fit next to my credit card in my wallet. The inconvenience is a barrier to enjoying the advantages of digital\u00a0currencies. The\u00a0goal Create a HW wallet that is the size and shape of a credit card, it could be 3 times thicker than a credit card and still fit in a normal wallet. It\u00a0needs a display - it could be a low resolution b\u0026w\u00a0display two or more\u00a0buttons to plug into a USB\u00a0port securely sign transactions and create\u00a0addresses"

 "tags": "freelance, coworking, dublin, element78, regus, officesuites, cocreate, studio9, glandore, tcube ",			"body": "Last week I arrived in Dublin and had two days to find a coworking space. I ran around Dublin visiting as many as\u00a0possible. I\u2019m looking to rent a hotdesk, which means I don\u2019t have any storage space at the office and I don\u2019t have a particular\u00a0desk. Below are my impressions of eight businesses offering either hot desks or dedicated desks, ranked in order of preference. It\u2019s subjective. The going rate in Dublin seems to be \u20ac200 \u2014 \u20ac300 per month for a hot desk. Hours range from 9am - 7pm Monday - Friday, to\u00a024/7. First place: Dogpatch\u00a0Labs Dogpatch offer a coworking space and access to a community of tech startups. They run regular networking and mentoring events and occupy 3 floors of a warehouse next to an old dock. The offices have a range of interiors styles. The middle level is fairly standard but pleasant open plan offices, the top floor is a flexible working space with event areas. The lower level is a series of vaults that each contain meeting rooms of various sizes. There\u2019s a lot going on and there\u2019s a good buzz in the\u00a0air. The range of interior spaces is a big plus for me and I\u2019m looking forward to being able to switch up my working environment through the day. There\u2019s a couple of kitchen areas, and a table football and table-tennis table on the top level. Access is 6am - midnight, and a hot desk is \u20ac200 per month. A dedicated desk is\u00a0\u20ac400. Dogpatch occupy less than a quarter of the warehouse building, the remainder of the space is used as a shopping mall and a museum. In my opinion Dogpatch is by far the best value and if you\u2019re working in tech it\u2019ll probably be your go-to\u00a0solution. Second place: Studio9 These guys are great. The space is a lot smaller that Dogpatch, comprising only ~12 desks. It\u2019s a basement, but don\u2019t let that put you off \u2014 its open plan and has large windows at either end. The space is well designed and uses a lot of light colours and textures, including wood on the walls and floors. There are also plenty of pot plants. These combine to give a bright and airy atmosphere that feels very natural and\u00a0bright. There are alcoves down one side of the main room which serve as meeting rooms, and a garden and basic kitchen at the back. The owners want the space to foster a community, and I expect that this is achieved. There are no dedicated offices and no teams using multiple desks, everyone is an independent\u00a0worker. The desks are large, and each has its own little wall to provide some privacy. \u20ac200 per month ongoing, or \u20ac250 for just one month. They offer a trial day for\u00a0free. Third place: OfficeSuites The building looks well run and appears clean and fresh with adequate resources. The building is an old Georgian tenement with high ceilings, cornicing and lots of natural light. The furnishings and decor lean towards corporate rather than something more interesting, but this works well to add a professional feel to the homely architecture. Access is\u00a024/7. There\u2019s only two rooms for hotdesking, and most of the building is given to private offices. There\u2019s a garden with bike storage, meeting rooms and a quiet room for calls. Lockers are extra. They also offer a free day as a\u00a0trial. \u20ac249 p/m for desk access 9am-7pm Monday -\u00a0Friday Fourth place: Element78 Friendly and well resourced, but very corporate. The architecture is corporate glass and steel. They\u2019re situated on the ground floor in a posh business district with large financials for neighbours. It\u2019s too corporate for me, but if you wanted an impressive place to meet clients and a nice address, this could be it. There were about 15 hot-desks for rent, plus plenty of dedicated desks. Clients seemed to include mostly young tech companies and tech\u00a0freelancers. I\u2019m hoping to find somewhere with more of a community, more inspiring architecture, and more character. I was offered a free day as a\u00a0trial. \u20ac200 for the first month then \u20ac350\u00a0p/m Fifth place: Glandore Glandore offer a relatively luxurious package with a corporate feel. They have a few buildings in Dublin and only the flagship has hotdesking space. There\u2019s a super looking restaurant and a large club room to relax in, but these are features that I don\u2019t need, and the rates aren\u2019t competitive if all you need is a desk and somewhere to take calls. It\u2019s set up for teams and for impressing clients, and independent tech workers are probably better off\u00a0elsewhere. \u20ac295\u00a0p/m Sixth place: Regus Regus offer a polished on boarding experience and the friendly staff were quick to respond and generally helpful, but the office space was bland, grey and generic. The rooms I visited didn\u2019t have external windows and it reminded me of the rooms banks often put auditors in. If grey walls and tube lights are your thing then this is for you. 24/7 access, and meeting rooms equipped with\u00a0A/V. \u20ac299.70\u00a0p/m. Seventh place: CoCreate I visited the southern branch and thought the building was a bit shabby and needed a new layer of paint. I recognised the desks as some of the cheapest available from IKEA. The rooms were small and needed cleaning, and there was weird art on the\u00a0wall. The thought of paying \u20ac200 a month to sit at a small wobbly desk put me off. The place was also almost deserted. Maybe their other branch is better, but this is not for\u00a0me. \u20ac220\u00a0p/m. Last place: tCube Last and least, tCube seems to be putting in zero effort. When I visited I saw two rooms that needed painting, disorganised furniture and abandoned bits of computers lying around. The kitchen isn\u2019t high spec and the meeting room isn\u2019t big enough. I was also given a speech about how great the wifi was - a prerequisite that was taken for granted everywhere else. At \u20ac300 p/m for a dedicated desk its easy to find better value\u00a0elsewhere."

I\u2019m excited about this because I get to work on a really ambitious project using new technology to do something innovative and\u00a0valuable. Bitnation Bitnation\u2019s purpose is to offer the same services as governments do, in a way that delivers more benefit to\u00a0users. In the West this may not immediately sound like a big deal. Our governments are fairly organised and the services are usually \u201cgood enough\u201d. Most significantly, we are not used to thinking about ID services (passports, visa, drivers licences) or registration services (land registry, marriage certificates) as a service that we are customers of - like our internet service provider, or our electricity\u00a0supplier. In many parts of the world dysfunctional or unjust governments represent a huge obstacle to improving everyday life, the progress and achievement that many people can hope to realise is limited because of\u00a0this. If there was a viable alternative to a passport from a jurisdiction renowned for forgery, or a credit rating that acknowledged your land holdings despited your governments inability to maintain a credible database, then you could begin to travel, trade and enjoy the benefits that citizens of many western states take for\u00a0granted. I\u2019m excited that I get to use my skills in an innovative tech company that is aiming to do something really\u00a0positive. Services include secure ID systems, asset registry and dispute resolution. Identification (in particular) is an area full of problems, and blockchain tech could offer some really significant improvements. Bitnation wants to create a platform where voluntary nations can be created and administered, and where people can choose what jurisdictional system they are part of. If this is widely implemented it will be\u00a0unprecedented. Jurisdictions would offer their own services according to their own principles, and because they are easy to create and membership is voluntarily, jurisdictions would compete to attract citizens. This should lead to improvements for the users of each service, and is intended to provide an alternative to the slow, expensive and opaque processing methods commonly associated with services from geographically defined\u00a0nationstates."

 "tags": "ethereum, parity, blockchains, fintech, multi-sig, wallet ",			"body": "I recently set up a multi-sig Ethereum wallet and I couldn\u2019t find clear instructions. Here they are, I hope these instructions are useful for someone looking to get\u00a0started. You\u2019ll need a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in order to deploy a wallet. There are several apps that you can use. I\u2019ve used Parity because I found it simple and\u00a0quick. Ethereum\u00a0Wallets Wallets are a type of contract and there are two types of wallet, the Multi-Sig wallet and the Watch wallet. An Ethereum account is required to communicate with a contract so if you want a multi-sig wallet with 3 signatories (for example) then you will need to have set up at least 1 of those 3 Ethereum accounts before creating the\u00a0wallet. Parity From their\u00a0website: Integrated directly into your Web browser, Parity is the fastest and most secure way of interacting with the Ethereum\u00a0network. You can do a bunch of stuff with Parity including mining Ether, manage accounts, interact with different dapps, send/receive from different accounts, and set up contracts. On the accounts tab, you can quickly set up Multi-Signature wallets. If you use the Chrome plugin you will also get handy notifications when transactions are confirmed or contracts\u00a0deployed. Download and open\u00a0Parity For MacOS you can download and install Parity by visiting the Parity site and downloading the installer, or from the terminal using curl or\u00a0Homebrew. Simple\u00a0option $ bash \u003c(curl https://get.parity.io -kL) Homebrew Detailed instructions are here. brew tap paritytech/paritytech brew install parity --stable If you used the installer, then you open Parity opening the app and then using the logo in the\u00a0menubar. If you used Brew, then start Parity with the following\u00a0command parity and then go to the following address in your\u00a0browser: http://127.0.0.1:8180/ You should now see something similar to\u00a0this: Add or create\u00a0accounts Select the Accounts tab from the top of the page and then select \u201c+ Account\u201d. Either create new accounts or import them using your preferred method. You don\u2019t need to import all the accounts that will be part of the multi-sig wallet, but you will need to import or create the account that will own the wallet you are about to create. This account will need to have a large enough Ether balance to pay the transaction costs to deploy the multi-sig wallet onto the Blockchain. The costs are tiny, but they are greater than\u00a0zero. Create the multi-sig\u00a0wallet Once you\u2019ve either created or imported the account which will deploy the wallet, select \u201c+ Wallet\u201d from the accounts tab and choose \u201cMulti-Sig wallet\u201d. Click\u00a0next. Enter a name for the wallet, if you want you can add a local description. The \u201cFrom account\u201d will be the contract owner and this account\u00a0will Be one of the\u00a0signatories.

You\u2019ll need to add one line for each signatory and these accounts will also own the wallet once it is\u00a0deployed. In the \u201crequired owners\u201d section, specify how many accounts will need to approve a transaction that is above the daily transaction\u00a0limit. Use the \u201cwallet day limit\u201d to set how much Ether can be spent by each account per day without needing another account to approve the transaction. Set an amount of 0 if you want all transactions to require approval, or turn the option off using the slider to the right (which just specifies a huge\u00a0number). Click \u201cnext\u201d and you\u2019ll be shown a pop-up window to approve the creation of the wallet. You will need to enter the password of the account which is creating the wallet, and once you click \u201cConfirm request\u201d the funds in the creators accounts will be used to deploy the contract on chain and create the multi-sig\u00a0wallet. Adding an existing multi-sig\u00a0wallet Once your wallet is created and deployed, you\u2019ll need to add it to other parity clients so that the other signatories can make or confirm transactions, and view the wallets balance. This is done by adding a watch\u00a0wallet. Process: Accounts tab \u003e + Wallet \u003e Watch wallet \u003e enter the address of the multi-sig\u00a0wallet. The other signatories will now be able to view the wallet\u2019s balance, get notifications about pending confirmations, and be able to make and monitor\u00a0transactions. Managing a multi-sig\u00a0wallet Anyone can put funds into the wallet, just like a normal account. Just send Ether to the wallet\u2019s\u00a0address. At the top of the page you click \u201cEdit\u201d to change the local name and description of the\u00a0wallet. \u201cSettings\u201d allows you add or remove owners (signatories) of the wallet and change the required number of approvals and the wallet day limit. If you change these settings then the changes will need to be executed on the blockchain and the account requesting the change will therefore need to pay the required funds. Depending on the settings being changed, other accounts will need to approve the changes before they are\u00a0implemented. \u201cForget\u201d will remove the multi-sig wallet from your accounts\u00a0tab. Moving funds out of a multi-sig\u00a0wallet Click on \u201cTransfer\u201d in the wallet management window (pictured above) to begin withdrawing funds from the\u00a0wallet. Select the token you want to transfer - Ethereum is the only default\u00a0option. \u201cSender address\u201d - specify which account wants to withdraw the funds from the multi-sig\u00a0wallet. \u201cRecipient address\u201d - specify which account will receive the\u00a0funds. \u201cAmount to transfer\u201d - specify how much you want to transfer. If the amount is greater than the remaining daily limit you will get a warning bar telling you the transaction will require confirmation from other wallet\u00a0owners. If you want to specify the maximum transaction fee (a payment with a lower fee will be confirmed more slowly than usual) tick the \u201cadvanced sending options\u201d\u00a0box. Clicking \u201csend\u201d will bring you to the confirmation stage where you can enter the password for the account which is requesting the\u00a0transfer. If approval from other wallet owners is required and they are also using Parity, then they can see that their approval is required in two ways: The signer tab will show there is a pending request. The wallet management window (accessed from the accounts tab) has a \u201cpending transactions\u201d section where any confirmation requests will be shown."

 "tags": "career, corporate, london ",			"body": "2014 -\u00a02017 Having made arrangements to leave London, it seems like a reasonable time to reflect on my time\u00a0here. London is a tough city to live in \u2014 it\u2019s big enough that a sub 1-hour commute is considered good, and it\u2019s super expensive. My stay in London has been defined by my quest to complete my graduate scheme and qualify as an\u00a0accountant. When I first arrived I had no idea what London or working in a corporate would be like. I was coming from academia, and my motivation for moving to finance could be summed up in two\u00a0points: Understand more about the 2008 financial\u00a0crisis Get paid more for using mostly the same skills (math) as in\u00a0engineering I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with these motivations, but I should have been making a long term career plan\u00a0instead. When I started my job I was surprised at the 6 weeks of induction and hot-desking. Life as an auditor felt nomadic, as everyone would spend large amounts of time at client\u2019s offices, and no-one has their own desk in our office. The only thing you really own is your knowledge and your network of\u00a0relationships. In 2014, I arrived with a high opinion of my employer and the view that I would be staying for several years. Having escaped the financial insecurity of short-term research grants, I\u2019d moved back to my home country to contribute to the system that educated me. I was happy to have a regular job with a decent, predictable\u00a0salary. A phrase that kept coming to mind back then was \u201caccountant factory\u201d. Our training materials were scripted and everything was a standardised process. We were being processed. Graduates in, corporate accountants\u00a0out. The company is huge and so are the efficiencies and barriers to competition that come with this. When I arrived I was impressed there were free biscuits, and it felt presumptuous to put a meeting in someones diary. Now I ignore any communications addressed to a mailing\u00a0list. Accountant The toughest experiences were related to the accountancy qualification. Na\u00efvely I had believed that the qualification wouldn\u2019t be a big deal and I didn\u2019t give any thought to it when I applied \u2014 I just wanted to find out how banks worked. If there were some exams to be done then it would be fine, I\u2019d already achieved a PhD and I would handle\u00a0it. That turned out to be a mistake. A huge mistake. The alarm bells should have rung louder when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so that they could get the qualification (and were already intending to leave asap afterwards). Doing the pre-course work before college wasn\u2019t trivial. College - I was being sent to a classroom again. We were being taken out of the office, away from clients, and put in a classroom to prepare for these\u00a0exams\u2026 Starting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant, without considering the effort and time involved to qualify was dumb. It\u2019s an oversight I find hard to\u00a0believe. The disappointment and sadness at having to study again was profound. The teaching and assessment style was several steps behind what I\u2019d become used to. Compared to the depth, autonomy and research-focus of a doctorate, writing cookie-cutter essays in time-pressured exams felt stupid. The exams were hard and I failed several of them, probably because of my low morale whilst revising. Retaking them required more weekends and annual leave being spent away from my family, camped-out in libraries and\u00a0offices. This required much patience and generosity from Ritsya, who having not seen me for long periods during my doctorate expected us to have a more normal lifestyle when we came to London. I found it miserable to pause my social life and other interests whilst studying, and then I would try to rush back to them when I had the time, knowing that soon I\u2019d have to pause them\u00a0again. If I hadn\u2019t already studied in Vienna, this process of working and studying in London would have been exciting and felt valuable or special. I\u2019d passed enough exams though to know that they\u2019re never as important as they\u2019re made out to be, and whatever it was that was missing from my life wasn\u2019t going to be found in another\u00a0qualification. On the upside though, the ACA is the most practical qualification I\u2019ve gained and has taught me many useful aspects of business and finance. I\u2019m glad to finally see business not as some mysterious system but something attainable and\u00a0understandable. Neighbourhood Living in London has also required a lot of time on trains \u2014 my door to desk commute is about an hour each way, and I\u2019ve never lived somewhere in London that hasn\u2019t felt transient. We\u2019ve needed to live near a station and didn\u2019t want to commute more than an hour and that\u2019s put us in neighbourhoods with other young professionals who also don\u2019t have long term plans (or financial ability) to stay in the city. We\u2019re all looking to move on and move up as fast as possible. I want to leave London partly because there are so many people with the same attitudes and priorities as my\u00a0own\u2026 Corporate\u00a0Culture Back in the office I spent the first few months figuring out how people were organised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. I think it took me about a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years to feel like I could do all aspects of my job with certainty. There is a difference between how things are spoken about, and how things actually\u00a0happen. My experience has been that performance is all that matters and behaviour is defined by self-interest. I don\u2019t think this is different from previous environments I\u2019ve worked in \u2014 academia isn\u2019t any different1 and the construction industry certainly isn\u2019t. I wonder if the only way people can endure it is if they\u2019ve not experienced anything else, or think it normal, or necessary. I find myself wishing we could be kinder to each other, and that we could create structures that incentivise mutual\u00a0support. Corporate finance usually appears clean and well presented. Its people appear dependable and capable. The culture is sanitised and there\u2019s a lot of pressure to conform - you can see it in the clothes and accessories we wear and the jokes we tell each other in the\u00a0canteen. I came to see my office as a glass and steel cathedral. I read about the Middle East, and migrants arriving in Europe, and tower blocks burning, and felt really\u00a0disconnected. Despite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we don\u2019t ask each other how we can help. Maybe we are too busy, or feel powerless to help. Apparently we do not know how to help, despite our wealth, talents, education and\u00a0connections. I remember watching a man leave the office one day and thought that if he gave his whole career and left his firm after decades of service, there would be nothing left to identify him after a few weeks. The work will always get done. Market forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. The City rolls\u00a0on. Publications trump almost all other metrics, and the incentives to publish quantity over quality are such that risky or slow research is inexcusable. The metrics used to standardise success and allocate resources can be subverted just as well in academia as in any other industry. What management measures, the team prioritises.\u00a0\u21a9"

 "tags": "blockchains, digital currencies, distributed ledger technology, distributed consensus, sybil ",			"body": "Maintain an accurate list of transactions across a large group of users, without a central\u00a0authority This is part 2 of an introduction to the key features of a generalised blockchain. Part 1 introduced key features of immutable record creation between 2 parties using public key cryptography. Part 2 explores how a network of users can maintain the same (true) list of transactions and protect each other against\u00a0fraud. Broadcasting transactions to the\u00a0network In Part 1 we saw Lizzie, John and Chris exchanging coins. Lizzie also paid John with coins that were owed to her by Chris. These transactions were authenticated using PKI\u00a0which: Ensured transaction\u00a0integrity Prevented participants claiming that they didn\u2019t make a past\u00a0transaction Prevents anyone creating a transaction on someone else\u2019s behalf without their\u00a0consent. As the number of people in the network grows, the transfer of coins from one user to another becomes harder to track. If every users ledger is not identical then the opportunity arises to use coins that have already been spent to pay someone who doesn\u2019t know they\u2019ve already been\u00a0used. This is double spending, and is possible because the ledger that is shared amongst all members of the group only has weak consistency - it is not necessarily correct all the time in all\u00a0locations. Weak\u00a0Consistency Weak consistency could be solved by requiring that everyone votes to accept a transaction before it is accepted into the ledger (Unanimous consensus), or to save time we could reduce the requirements so that only 50% of all users validate a transaction before it is accepted into the ledger (Quorum consensus). Either of these solutions is possible for a small local group with a list of all\u00a0users. However Unanimous or Quorum Consensus doesn\u2019t solve the weak consistency problem\u00a0if: The group is\u00a0large The group is small but spread across different locations or\u00a0timezones It is not possible to know how many members there are and therefore what proportion of users are\u00a0participating. The real identity of a user is\u00a0unknown In these cases a peer-to-peer network is required where transactions between users require approval by other users before being confirmed. This has not been trivial to solve, as some users would be incentivised to be dishonest, and some may make mistakes. This is the distributed consensus problem, which on wikipedia is defined\u00a0as: The consensus problem requires agreement among a number of agents for a single data value. Some of the processes (agents) may fail or be unreliable in other ways, so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow put forth their candidate values, communicate with one another, and agree on a single consensus\u00a0value. Distributed\u00a0Consensus When the number and identity of participants is known, distributed consensus is possible. Two types of protocol which allows all users in a distributed system to agree on a transaction are the Paxos family of protocols and the Two-phase commit protocol. Both of these would require that at least 50% of all users reach agreement in order to add a new\u00a0transaction. However in a public peer-to-peer network the total number of active users is not known - its fast and cheap to create new user profiles, and existing user profiles may become dormant. This makes it impossible to know how many users 50% would be. Additionally, because its possible to cheaply create new user profiles (just generate a new public-private key pair), a single actor could generate and control many user accounts in order to have many votes and force incorrect transactions onto the ledger. An attack where one user subverts a network by creating many profiles is known as a Sybil attack. Proof of\u00a0Work The solution to the Sybil attack is to increase the cost of verifying a transaction such that the cost exceeds the reward. This is achieved through proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms, which are computationally expensive for a sender claiming to have verified a transaction, and computationally simple for the receiver to verify that the sender has validated the\u00a0transaction. One possible Proof of Work approach is to require that the hash of a verification message begins with a certain set of characters. The chosen set of characters is called a nonce and the only way to create a verification message with an acceptable hash is to try many slightly different messages. For example, a nonce may be 3 zeros. It\u2019s arbitrary, but the longer the nonce is the more difficult it becomes to find a hash that fits the\u00a0requirements. This is because a hash is a random list of characters, and altering even a single part of the data being hashed will result in a completely different hash value. Therefore there is no way to predict a hash value. The only way to generate a hash with the required none is to repeatedly alter the data being hashed (even by just one character) until a hash with the required features is randomly achieved. This is computationally expensive to achieve, but computationally simple to\u00a0verify. Using the method, a user who seeks to verify a transaction and broadcast the result must (once they\u2019ve verified the transactions) repeatedly try different messages until they randomly find a message that meets the nonce requirements. It is simple for a user to check if a transaction verification message meets the nonce requirements, because it is simple to inspect a hash and compare it to the\u00a0nonce. The effect of this requirement is a process that makes it expensive to claim that a transaction has been verified and cheap to check that verification claim. This removes the threat of a Sybil attack, but does not remove the distributed consensus problems created by not\u00a0knowing: The true identity of users in the\u00a0network How many users\u00a0exist This problem cannot be completely solved, and the practical solution is to relax the requirements such that the probability of accepting a fraudulent transaction is lower than some user defined threshold. This is acceptable because a user would require a higher degree of confirmation for a high-value transaction than they would for a low-value transaction, and would therefore be willing to incur more time and cost to verify a high value transaction and reduce the probability of accepting an incorrect transaction below a\u00a0threshold. If a user wishes to make fast or low-value transactions, or trusts the party they\u2019re transacting with, then they may accept a transaction without any other users on the network verifying that the sender has the required funds\u00a0available. However when the senders trustworthiness is not assured, verification is required. The more risky or valuable the transaction, the more users the receiver of the funds will ask to verify that the sender has access to the required funds. The higher the number of users, the higher the probability that a dishonest transaction will be identified before being\u00a0accepted. An appropriate level of verification will depend on the amount being transferred and how well the receiver of the funds knows the\u00a0sender. Transaction\u00a0fees Asking peers on the network to verify transactions introduces a new problem. Verifying a transaction requires time and effort, and incurs a cost. This cost requires that network participants be rewarded for correctly verifying transactions between other\u00a0participants. An attacker would only attack if the cost is less than the reward. Therefore the number and cost of verifications required should be just enough to make the cost of an attack more than the value of the\u00a0transaction. This introduces the problem that it costs more to verify a transaction than the value of the transaction itself. It is also create the recursive problem where the users who verified the first transaction would need to verify that the payment they received was then also valid. Furthermore, a high proportion of the original transaction value is spent as a transaction fee (for verification) which is not\u00a0efficient. These problems are avoided by combining multiple transactions and verifying them at the same time, broadcasting the successful verification of multiple transactions simultaneously by grouping the transactions together into a block of\u00a0transactions. By confirming multiple transactions at once (and proving it using proof-of-work), transaction fees can be aggregated (allowing each individual fee to be much lower). Each block includes a list of verified transactions, a reference to the previous block, and a block ID. Incentivised social\u00a0responsibility The transaction verification process outlined above is remarkable because it creates a demand for new participants to the network by creating a financial incentive to verify transactions. This makes the network more secure as increasing the number of participants makes a sybil attack more\u00a0difficult. Summary Users generate new transactions and broadcast them on a peer-to-peer network for\u00a0verification An idle user listens for new transactions and collects them until the sum of all transactions\u2019 verification fees is greater than the cost the user will incur to verify them and meet the proof-of-work\u00a0requirements The idle user adds an extra transaction to their list of transactions that transfers the sum of the transaction fees to their own\u00a0address. The idle user generates the block of newly verified transactions, referencing the previously verified block so that transactions can be chronologically ordered and completing the proof-of-work challenge. This new block is then broadcast to the\u00a0network. Other users are listening for new block announcements. These users verify that the block is valid according to the proof-of-work requirements and the order of the\u00a0blocks. Users with unverified transactions look inside the verified block to see if their pending transactions have been\u00a0accepted. Competing to validate blocks of\u00a0transactions Each user can choose which transactions they verify, and how many to verify before beginning the proof-of-work requirement and hopefully collecting the transaction fees. This lack of order around transaction verification is fine because the only way to increase the probability of being the first to claim the transaction fees associated with a collection of transactions (a block) is to spend more CPU power searching for the required partial hash\u00a0collision. If two users complete a block at approximately the same time then the blockchain will look different in different parts of the network, as each completed block begins to propagate and other users accept the new block and add it to their ledger. This is ok if a rule is enforced that requires a user to always accept the longest chain of\u00a0blocks. This works because if multiple blocks are created at the same time, the time it takes to create subsequent blocks will vary due to the random behaviour of the proof-of-work algorithm. Therefore chains of different length will always exist and one version of the block chain will be longer than the others, providing a clear candidate for which branch of the blockchain to use. If there are transactions in the discarded branch which are not present in the new (longest) blockchain then they are added back into the pool of transactions awaiting\u00a0verification. A block of transactions in never absolutely\u00a0immutable The above procedure for verifying transactions and adding new blocks onto the chain means that even if a user inspects a new block and sees that their transaction has been verified, its possible that in the future a longer chain will be discovered (which must be accepted) which doesn\u2019t include their\u00a0transaction. Therefore any block could potentially be removed, which means a transaction is never completely verified. However the probability of a block being removed decreases as the number of blocks after it increases. This means verification can be thought of in terms of the number of blocks that have been added to the chain after the block containing the\u00a0transaction. If you are willing to accept a high level of risk, or you trust the party you are transacting with you could opt for a small number of blocks to be added after the block containing your transaction. This has the benefit of increasing the speed of the transaction verification. If the transaction is risky or high-value, you might require a larger number of blocks to be added to the chain before accepting the transaction. This will increase the time required to verify the transaction, but reduce the probability that a longer chain will undo the block containing the transaction in\u00a0question."

Life so far has been predominantly about education, and that stage is over now. I\u2019m walking away from what I\u2019ve come to see as a lifestyle and career that has too many contradictions, it doesn\u2019t make sense to live like this. Ultimately I want to develop multiple sources of passive income. I want to\u00a0create. Summer\u00a02017 The last few months have been intense, with some weeks leaving me feeling ambitious and energetic, and others feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I need to get better at defining a goal, taking the quickest path there, and ignoring interesting\u00a0distractions. Ritsya is brave enough and imaginative enough to force me to think big and consider how to live a better life. My biggest fear is that I screw it up, shooting myself in the foot and Ritsya and my daughter also. We were headed safely to an unremarkable existence and it would be terrible to swap that for something worse. That won\u2019t\u00a0happen. I know that I make better decisions and produce my best work under pressure, I thrive when I\u2019m perceived as an underdog. I need to accept this without using it as a reason to be foolish. Whilst I don\u2019t have a clear plan, or direction, or goal, (I have many of them) I\u2019ve got skills and I want to see what I can make. I\u2019ll never do my best work, using my most productive combination of skills and experiences, if I\u2019m a cog in someone else\u2019s\u00a0machine. It\u2019s safer being an employee than self-employed. I guess the price of removing self-employment risks is the difference between the value you generate for your employer and what you\u2019re paid. I think those risks are overpriced, and most people are more capable than they realise. Sometimes you have to walk into a situation to find out how to make the most of it. And sometimes you have to leave a place in order to gain\u00a0perspective. Autumn\u00a02016 Last year my boss gave me some advice that was supposed to be encouraging. I\u2019d requested to reduce my involvement with some stuff that was unrelated to my job so that I could contribute more to my team and still maintain some semblance of a work/life\u00a0balance. My boss was pretty clear that reducing my involvement in the extra stuff would not be possible. During our conversation he advised me not to worry about how much I contributed to the team because \u201cthe work will get done anyway\u201d. This was meant to be encouraging, but instead removed any conviction that the work I did was\u00a0important."

 "tags": "lis, startup, fintech, europe ",			"body": "Whilst at the Lisbon Investment Summit I went to a session called \u201cWhat it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe\u201d by Oussama Ammar. I\u2019ve written generally about the summit here. Oussama spoke with passion and humour. It\u2019s clear that he cares about encouraging would-be founders and confronting some of the cultural hurdles that exist in Europe. These are my notes from the\u00a0session: If you are serious about building something that matters then you have a great and exciting future\u00a0ahead. You can never predict who will be successful and who will fail. There are a lot of dumb successful people and clever founders can\u00a0fail. It\u2019s really important to learn how to leverage your time effectively. You can lose anything else and get it back but you can never recover the time you\u2019ve already\u00a0spent. The only way to succeed is to try\u00a0hard. It\u2019s hard to do something that\u00a0matters. In Europe you need to be more ambitious than average (measured against other countries) because the environment makes it harder to be an entrepreneur. (Attitudes to risk, comfort, security, expectations of failure.. are all unhelpful for\u00a0founders.) It\u2019s not impossible, just harder. So be more\u00a0ambitious. Everyone is replaceable, no-one is\u00a0unique. You can always lose money and replace it. There is so much money in the\u00a0world. Take a look at Crunchbase and see the failure rate for companies that raised $1m - $10m, it is the same rate for those that raised\u00a0$10m+. If you lose money on a project you will learn things from that experience and you can leverage that\u00a0learning \u2026 But you will never get back the time you\u00a0spent. Zombies are companies that make enough money to survive but not enough to provide joy to the people in the company - aim high\u00a0and\u2026 Starting a company is a big deal, like starting a marriage. Think hard about what you will be doing, what problem you are trying to solve, who you will be working\u00a0with. In Europe there is not enough money to go around and this makes pitching hard. Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t have this\u00a0problem. On average a startup in Europe will raise less than a startup in the USA. Europe is irrationally concerned about risk. USA is less concerned with risk and this is very\u00a0helpful. So be pragmatic about\u00a0risk. Incorporate in London where the laws are good, even if you don\u2019t want to operate in the UK. It has a better designed system of corporate law. Estonia is also\u00a0good. Best European city for\u00a0founders London, Paris,\u00a0Berlin.. There isn\u2019t a best city because none are\u00a0holistic London has the\u00a0money Paris has engineering and product development (and no-one outside Paris knows the products\u00a0exist) Berlin has automation and execution, execution and\u00a0scaling \u2026You need to draw on all 3 of these cities, which when taken together can surpass Silicon\u00a0Valley. Anecdotes The founder of Slack lives in Vancouver with his wife and kids. He spends 1 day each week in California and everyone thinks Slack is Californian due to good marketing. Forget national pride, be pragmatic. Leverage the\u00a0internet. The founders of Airbnb would fly from New York to California for 1 day each week. They were originally in California where AirBnB started, but decided that if they could make it work in New York then AirBnB would be a success, so they moved to New York and flew back for meetings , etc. If you ask Europeans to come to a meeting in London (which is not as far as California is from New York) people start complaining and deciding they can\u2019t be\u00a0bothered."

 "tags": "fintech, startup, europe, lis ",			"body": "I attended the Lisbon Investment Summit on June 6 and 7 as part of the Oula.la InsurTech startup team with John Sullivan. It was the first startup conference I\u2019d been to and I arrived hoping to have some useful conversations and understand more about the Fintech and startup spaces in Europe. As usual I wanted to focus on tech, finance and\u00a0blockchains. Who was\u00a0there As well as some outstanding sessions there was a high ratio of investors to startups. This made talking to VCs, bankers and M\u0026A lawyers really easy. I was happy to meet a London-based and Fintech-focussed VC when I sat down to have lunch, and thanks to interrupting a session to ask blockchain related questions on Day 1, a banker struck up a conversation with me over breakfast the next day. I met a lot of people across many relevant roles, and once I\u2019ve worked through my notes and my new collection of business cards I hope to have some great follow-up\u00a0meetings. Useful\u00a0Sessions The most useful sessions for me\u00a0were: \u201cWhat it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe\u201d by Oussama Ammar from TheFamily \u201cUnderstanding Investment\u201d by Boris Golden from Partech\u00a0Ventures \u201cBuilding successful businesses on blockchain technologies\u201d a panel discussion moderated by Kevin Loaec, founder of the Chainsmiths blockchain consultancy, and including Mir Serena Liponi from Blockchain\u00a0Lab The blockchain session was valuable because it\u2019s unusual to meet people who have been working in the blockchain space for several years. I\u2019m always wary of being distracted by the hype and noise around developments in the blockchain space so I appreciated hearing some informed and level-headed\u00a0opinions. Political\u00a0Support The opening session included a speech from the Mayor of Lisbon and the next day opened with a speech from the Secretary of Industry. Both speeches conveyed an open and progressive attitude to international cooperation aimed at promoting and supporting founders and startups in Portugal. The warm words were supported by practical measures including tax incentives and a state-backed scheme to match amounts contributed by private investors. It was really refreshing to hear a politician extol the virtues of multinational cooperation and bringing different cultures into Portugal. I wish Britain could do this\u00a0too. On the topic of Brexit, which inevitably arose due to London\u2019s present role as a centre of finance and innovation, it seems Europe is still expecting the UK to come to its senses, and cannot understand why it\u2019s destroying its goodwill and reputation so\u00a0thoroughly. Overall The two days in Lisbon were full of useful and energetic conversations and it was a great experience pitching Oula.la multiple times and talking about what we\u2019re trying to do and how blockchains are a part of that. The opportunities to meet founders and investors are invaluable for making informed decisions. Lisbon is a beautiful city which I found easy to get around and always felt safe in. It\u2019s also refreshingly affordable!"

			"category": "Technical/Web",
			"url": "pelican2.html",
			"date": "1 June 2017",
 "tags": "pelican, jinja, python, twitter, facebook, blog, static site ",			"body": "Design My approach to building my blog is to keep it as simple as possible, only adding features when they make a significant improvement to how the content is understood and used. Therefore I\u2019ve done away with several features that would normally come baked into a WordPress theme. For example a footer full of links that would never be used, and a sidebar full of\u00a0distractions. I opted for a single column design that hopefully presents text-heavy articles clearly and intuitively (please leave a comment and tell me what you\u00a0think). Plugins My use of plugins to extend Pelican\u2019s functionality reflects this, there is the Neighbors plugin so that the next or previous post can be accessed from the bottom of a post without going back to the index, and the Tag Cloud plugin to reflect which subjects are written about the most (and provide a link to all relevant\u00a0articles). Speed The speed of the site is important because a faster site is more enjoyable to use. Therefore I\u2019ve minified the CSS and the JavaScript using the Assets plugin. I\u2019ve also set the CSS and JavaScript to load asynchronously. Images are optimised using the Optimize Images plugin so that their file size is as small as possible and they download quickly. The site uses CloudFlare\u2019s free CDN features so hopefully no matter when you view the site from you get a decent page\u00a0speed. Jinja\u00a0templates I\u2019ve also arranged the homepage so that posts are shown by their category and then by posting date. This may not work very well with a larger number of posts, but I\u2019ll only consider that problem once it presents itself. Designing for hypotheticals or conditions that don\u2019t yet exist is a waste of\u00a0time. There are examples of how I\u2019ve used Jinja templates below in the context of sharing my articles on Twitter and\u00a0Facebook. Plugin: Share\u00a0Post I noticed that my posts were beginning to get tweeted about, so I thought it would be useful to have some sharing buttons at the bottom of each post for Twitter, Facebook and Email. Looking at the Pelican Plugins repo on Github showed there was (as usual) a plugin for this (called Share Post), though I noted it hadn\u2019t been updated for a couple of\u00a0years. Installing and initial set-up was simple thanks to the readme on the git repo. You need to copy the plugin folder to the plugins directory, and add the name of the plugin to the list in pelicanconf.py. Then you need to copy paste some Jinja/HTML into the article.html template. That\u2019s enough to make it\u00a0work. I noted though that when I shared to Twitter the text to be tweeted was encapsulated in quotes and there was a \u2018b\u2019 at the front. I realised this was due to using Python 3.x when the plugin (which hadn\u2019t been updated for 2 years) was likely written for Python 2.x. A quick google and the obligatory trip to SO showed me how to convert a bytes string to a normal text\u00a0string. # Python 2 tweet = (\u0027%s%s\u0027 % (title, url)).encode(\u0027utf-8\u0027) # Python 3 tweet_as_byte = (\u0027%s%s\u0027 % (title, url)).encode(\u0027utf-8\u0027) tweet = str(tweet_as_byte,\u0027utf-8\u0027) I also found that an article couldn\u2019t be shared to twitter from a mobile device and this was due to the URL being incorrectly formatted. The new URL format required separate arguments for the URL, additional text and the twitter\u00a0handle: # Incorrect twitter_link = \u0027http://twitter.com/home?status=%s\u0027 % tweet # Correnct twitter_link = \u0027http://twitter.com/share?url=%s\u0026text=%s\u0026via=%s\u0027 % (url, tweet, t_handle) Using meta-data to specify tweet\u00a0text I thought it would be cool to add some default text to a tweet, as I\u2019ve enjoyed this feature on other blogs when I\u2019ve found a post I wanted to share on Twitter. - A user may know they want to share an article but if they\u2019re in a hurry it might be hard to find the right words, so why not provide a ready-made tweet. The text is editable so it\u2019s only a\u00a0suggestion. The text would be different for each post so it makes sense to specify it when writing the article. The article \u2018summary\u2019 would be too long, and I know that Pelican supports arbitrary meta-data tags. I assumed that Jinja would pick up the data the same way it picks up the \u2018standard\u2019 meta-data and added a function to\u00a0share_post.py. def article_tweet(content): tweet = \u0027\u0027 if hasattr(content, \u0027tweet\u0027): tweet = BeautifulSoup(content.tweet, \u0027html.parser\u0027).get_text().strip() return quote((\u0027%s\u0027 % (tweet)).strip().encode(\u0027utf-8\u0027)) else: return \u0027 \u0027 Once this function was working it was simply a case of calling the function and assigning the output to a variable I called \u201cTweet\u201d, and then adding \u201cTweet\u201d to the text string to be included in a tweets\u00a0text: tweet = article_tweet(content) tweet_as_byte = (\u0027%s\u0027 % (tweet)).encode(\u0027utf-8\u0027) tweet = str(tweet_as_byte,\u0027utf-8\u0027) t_handle = twitter_handle(content) There was a bit of fiddling around to make sure that the number of spaces between each part of the tweet was correct, but nothing as complicated as when making Time Until. Specifying the text and image in a Facebook\u00a0share Sharing to Facebook worked without any formatting problems, but it bugged me that the opening text of the article was being used in the preview that was shared to Facebook when I had a summary already prepared and that would be much more useful to potential readers. For some articles I also had an article image that I wanted to see being\u00a0used. Googling revealed that I needed to use particular meta tags in the webpage\u2019s header if I wanted to control what Facebook would pickup. Facebook uses the \u201copen graph\u201d standards so I would need the headers in my article pages to include the\u00a0following: `\u003c!-- Open Graph data --\u003e` `\u003cmeta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Title Here\" /\u003e` `\u003cmeta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" /\u003e` `\u003cmeta property=\"og:url\" content=\"http://www.example.com/\" /\u003e` `\u003cmeta property=\"og:image\" content=\"http://example.com/image.jpg\" /\u003e` `\u003cmeta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Description Here\" /\u003e I could see that I already had some meta tags being generated using the Jinja templates so I set about copy-pasting and modifying them to build the new tags. I had some issues with trailing white space or line breaks being included within the content string. This was solved like\u00a0so: {# Adding \u0027-\u0027 after and before the %\u0027s strips white space and line breaks #} {% block description %} {%- if article.summary -%} {{ article.summary|striptags|truncate(200)|e }} {%- else -%} {{ article.content|striptags|truncate(200)|e }} {%- endif -%} {% endblock description %} I also needed to use some blocks more than once, because a description tag was already included but Facebook wants an \u201cog:description\u201d, and Twitter wants a \u201cTwitter:Description\u201d too. All three of these tags will include the same text (generated in the Jinja2 snippet above). If a block only needs to be used once then it\u2019s generated like\u00a0this; \u003cmeta name=\"description\" content=\"{% block description %}{% endblock description %}\"\u003e But If you call \u201c{% block description %}{% endblock description %}\u201d again Jinja will throw you an error. The documentation (and SO) reveal that the solution is to\u00a0use: \u003cmeta property=\"og:description\" content=\"{{ self.description() }}\"\u003e This allows you to reuse blocks multiple times and keep your templates\u00a0tidy. Finally, when I was testing Facebook to see if the correct text or image was being picked up I was initially frustrated to see that the new tags were not having any effect. This is because Facebook crawls your site and saves what it finds. If you want it to take a fresh look at your page with its new meta tags, you need to tell Facebook to crawl the page again, using the Facebook linter/debugger. You can see the new sharing buttons below, please click them and see what\u00a0happens! Note: My first article describing how I began to use Pelican is here"

 "tags": "blockchains, digital currencies, distributed ledger technology, public key cryptography ",			"body": "How to maintain a reliable list across a small network without a central\u00a0authority This is part 1 of an introduction to the key features of a generalised blockchain. I haven\u2019t included references to Bitcoin or any particular digital currencies or blockchain implementations. This is because a digital currency is just one application of blockchain\u00a0technology. Create a financial document that cannot be forged or\u00a0disputed Let\u2019s imagine there is a village somewhere where people still trade by bartering. John has some apples whilst Lizzie has some oranges. John would like an orange, and offers Lizzie an apple in exchange. She accepts, and writes John a\u00a0receipt. Date: 1234 From: Lizzie To: John What: 1 Orange Price: 1 Apple So far, so good. The receipt is evidence of the transaction. The next day John wants an orange but doesn\u2019t have anything to exchange. He offers to write Lizzie a note saying he owes Lizzie 1 orange (an IOU). They think about this and agree that John should sign the note so that Lizzie can prove that John owes her 1\u00a0orange. Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange Signed: John\u0027s signature, Lizzie\u0027s signature This IOU is a nice gesture, but it\u2019s simple to forge. Lizzie has the only copy of the IOU and once Lizzie has seen Johns signature, she could easily copy it and create more IOU\u2019s. She could also change this IOU from 1 orange to 11 oranges (for example) and John couldn\u2019t prove what the original amount was. If Lizzie and John disagreed over what was owed it would be impossible to know who was telling the truth. It\u2019s one person\u2019s word against the\u00a0other. Lizzie realises this and suggests an improvement - they will find a witness and make 3 copies of the IOU. Each copy will be signed by Lizzie, John and the Witness. Lets call this witness\u00a0\u201cWalter\u201d. Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange Witness: Walter Signed: \"John\u0027s signature\", \"Lizzie\u0027s signature\", \"Walter\u0027s signature\" This is a much stronger document and is more difficult to forge. If Lizzie changes the \u201cWhat:\u201d to \u201c11 Oranges\u201d, both John and Walter will have copies of the original with her signature on it. It will be 2 pieces of evidence against Lizzie\u2019s 1. Lizzie will be laughed out of court.\u00a0Hahaha. 3 Party transactions work pretty well, and this is how most transactions are recorded today. But there is a weakness: If Lizzie can bribe Walter then the transaction can be falsified! John would rely on Walter to verify his version of the transaction but would be let down by Walters lack of integrity. Lizzie and Walter could change 1 orange to 11 oranges and if Lizzie offered Walter some of the extra oranges this would give them both an incentive to forge the documentation. If Walter liked oranges enough, he might not care that his career as a witness will be\u00a0ruined. This is a problem for modern financial systems and a great deal of time, money and regulation is devoted to trying to ensure that third parties are trustworthy. E.G. If I buy a car and my bank is in cahoots with the car dealership, I could be defrauded. Reducing this risk to an acceptably low level makes financial services slower and more expensive than they would otherwise need to\u00a0be. The solution is public-key infrastructure (which is introduced in my previous post). In this system, each individual generates their own public-private key pair. They keep their private key private and make their public key freely available. A detailed description of public-key cryptography is out of scope for this post, but\u00a0briefly: A public key is derived from a private key, and this pair together have a set of unique mathematical properties. Either key can be used to encrypt a message but only the other key can be used to decrypt it. You cannot use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. If the private key is used to encrypt then anybody can decrypt (because the public key is publicly available) and whilst this is clearly a terrible way to keep a secret it\u2019s a great way to verify who encrypted the message, because only one person has the private key. Because of this, using a private key to encrypt a message is effectively creating a digital signature which cannot be forged. (If the public key is used to encrypt a message then only the private key can be used to decrypt it, and this approach is used to transfer secret data\u00a0securely). Back to the fruit. If Lizzie wants to accept John\u2019s IOU she can use public-key cryptography and no-one needs to worry about Walter. There are 3 steps to the\u00a0transaction. 1] Create the IOU stating that John owes Lizzie 1\u00a0orange. Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange 2] John creates a public private key pair and encrypts the IOU using his private key. He adds an unencrypted \u201cFrom\u201d\u00a0line. From: John Date: 1234 To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange \u003c- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key 3] John makes his public key freely available to anyone who wants\u00a0it. This will work because anybody (not just Lizzie) can check that John signed the IOU. The transaction can be verified by looking at the \u201cFrom\u201d part of that transaction, noticing that this transaction is supposedly from John and then using John\u2019s public key to decrypt the encoded \u201csignature\u201d\u00a0line. The signature can only be decrypted using John\u2019s public key if his private key was used to encrypt it. Because John is the only person with his private key, that proves the transaction is valid, and Lizzie isn\u2019t dishonestly creating a debt for John to\u00a0pay. Clearly if John discloses his private key (or its stolen) then he will make the system insecure, but this is a problem with John and his security protocols, not with public-key\u00a0cryptography. Create and maintain an accurate list of\u00a0transactions So far we\u2019ve seen how 1 IOU (for an orange) can be securely created, signed and verified. This process can extended to be used by more people to exchange more fruit. For\u00a0example. The original\u00a0note: From: John Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange \u003c- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key Then some additional\u00a0transactions: From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 Apples \u003c- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key From: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 1 Banana \u003c- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key From: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 2 Bananas \u003c- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key After these 4 transactions, between John, Chris and\u00a0Lizzie: John owes 1 orange to Lizzie and 1 banana to\u00a0Chris Lizzie owes 2 apples to\u00a0John Chris owes 2 bananas to\u00a0Lizzie. This is confusing, (and ridiculous). It is not possible to know who is the most in debt or who is the most wealthy. Lizzie owes 2 apples, but is owed 2 bananas and 1 apple. Does that mean her fruit business is losing money or making money? We cannot say. To be able to know we need to use the same unit of value for all the fruits. Lets say that an orange is worth 2 apples, and a banana is also worth 2 apples (therefore 1 banana = 1 orange.), also lets invent a currency called \u201ccoins\u201d and say 1 apple is worth 1 coin. The 4 transactions can now be rewritten\u00a0as: From: John // Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 2 coins \u003c- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 coins \u003c- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key From: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 2 coins \u003c- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key From: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 4 coins \u003c- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key By going through the list of transactions we can see\u00a0that: John owes Lizzie and Chris 2 coins each, and is owed 2 coins from Lizzie. His net amount is\u00a0-2 Lizzie owes John 2 coins but is owed 4 coins from Chris. Her net amount is\u00a0+2 Chris owes Lizzie 4 coins but is owed 2 coins from John. His net amount is\u00a0-2 So far Lizzie is the only person who appears to have any business\u00a0skills. What if Lizzie wanted to use the 4 coins that she is owed by Chris to buy something from John? Could she use this system to transfer Chris\u2019 promise to pay her 4 coins so that Chris would pay John instead? The fact that everyone can be sure that the record of the transactions is accurate and authentic allows a debt to be used as payment. Lizzie\u2019s transaction would look like\u00a0this: From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: ba781... \u003c- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key The \u201cWhat\u201d section contains a hash of the original transaction (with Chris) that she wants to transfer to John. A hash is the signature for a file or some text and in this case it is the signature for Lizzie\u2019s transaction with Chris. The signature is unique to each transaction and identifies which transaction is being used as payment. Because both transactions are signed using Lizzie\u2019s private key, it is simple to verify that Lizzie has the right to use this previous transaction where she is owed (or paid) some coins as payment to another\u00a0person. This shows how public-private key infrastructure can be used to securely record transactions and enable trade between a group of people, - under certain conditions. Blockchains can be used to transfer units of value like in this example, but we could just as easily put selfies or certificates of ownership (for houses, financial instruments, diamonds, etc) inside the \u201cWhat\u201d part of the transaction. If we make two other changes - removing the \u201cTo\u201d part of the transaction, and including a hash of the transaction as part of the text which is signed using a private key. If we do this, then a record would\u00a0be: From: Chris // Date: 2345, What: \"A photo of me\" \u003c- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key This would create a reliable record of what Chris claims he looks like. He can confidently send anyone this record and if they have his public key then they can verify that it is Chris himself who signed it and is asserting that the photo is him. If somebody changed the photo then the data in the transaction would change and the transaction will have a new hash value. The new hash value will not match the hash value contained within the signature, and the text in the signature cannot be changed because it can only be encrypted using Chris\u2019 private key, which only Chris has. Therefore it will be simple to show that someone other than Chris is trying to change the\u00a0photo. Another use for public-key cryptography arises if Chris were an employee in a bank, and the \u201cWhat\u201d contained documents about a customer the bank is providing financial services for. In this scenario, Chris (representing the bank) is effectively confirming the customer\u2019s true identity and documenting the evidence that\u2019s been collected to show that the bank knows who their customer really is. If the transaction included a new section called \u201cCustomer ID\u201d (for example) then a database of all customers whose identity checks have been successfully completed can be made. This can be shared with other departments (or banks) easily and immutably. This is the concept behind KYC on a\u00a0blockchain. Back to our fruit traders: At the moment a participant is allowed to carry a net negative balance. For this system to work in reality, the creation of \u201ccoins\u201d will need to be controlled in order to maintain their value. In the example above, people can freely create \u201ccoins\u201d and can also carry negative amounts of \u201ccoins\u201d. This would result in the value of a \u201ccoin\u201d plummeting. Therefore their creation (and conversion from fruit) must be controlled in a predictable\u00a0manner. Our examples so far only include 3 people. If there are a lot of people in the network it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to insist that everyone is present or online each time a new transaction is added to the list (the chain) of transactions. However if we allow transactions to be added whilst some people are offline we create an opportunity for fraud. The reasons why, and the solution to this and other problems will be described in part 2."

 "tags": "london, rent ",			"body": "Living in London is expensive, everyone in the UK knows this. Everyone knows that this is mostly due to the price of property, which we all enjoy talking\u00a0about. I\u2019ve lived here for 3 years now, and when my wife and I were both working we lived comfortably. Two incomes under one roof is just fine. Not as fine as in many other cities, but reasonable. Just over a year ago my first child was born, and now that my wife\u2019s maternity pay has ended we are a single income household. This is not\u00a0fine. Even though I earn almost \u00a350k/year, and any salary increase will be taxed at 40%, I cannot cover essential day-to-day costs. I\u2019m in the 40% tax bracket, and my basic monthly outgoings exceed my monthly take home pay by \u00a3400. If my employer wanted to pay me enough to cover essential costs, it would cost them approximately double the shortfall due to tax. None of this makes\u00a0sense. Salaries and living expenses have become really\u00a0disconnected. For most people the most obvious way to increase wealth is to buy property. Mortgage repayments are cheaper than rent, and the value of the property increases over time. Double win. But there is a big hurdle to overcome before this is possible - saving money for a deposit on a house is often impossible without external help (i.e. the \u201cBank of Mum and Dad\u201d), because so much of the money earnt must be spent on rent\u00a0first. It\u2019s a trap. Repayments on a mortgage are cheaper than paying rent, but you cannot save enough for a deposit\u00a0because; so much of your salary goes to paying rent1,\u00a0and the average cost of a flat in London is 500k2, which means a 5% deposit is \u00a325k \u2014 which is a higher deposit than you would need anywhere else in the UK, despite being the place you are least able to accumulate\u00a0it. What if my partner went back to work and we put our baby in childcare? Childcare is not cheap, and working would need to bring in more than the cost of childcare. This requires a higher than average salary from a graduate job, (which is the life stage when people might reasonably start having children), so unless both parents are unusually high earners that option isnt viable\u00a0either. Living in London is only financially possible if you are either single or household income is more than\u00a0\u00a360k/year. You\u2019d be lucky to find a 1 bedroom flat for less than \u00a31000/month\u00a0\u21a9 According to Rightmove, an estate agent with some useful price statistics.\u00a0\u21a9"

 "tags": "æternity, dlt, digital currencies, finance, blockchains ",			"body": "These are my notes on the \u00e6ternity blockchain project, I\u2019m not affiliated with the \u00e6ternity\u00a0team. \u00c6ternity is a new blockchain project that is pre-launch. The headline goal is to securely facilitate large volumes of smart-contracts which interface with external data sources. This is made possible via a decentralised oracle based on prediction markets. These terms are explained below. The \u00e6ternity project has proposed several notable technical\u00a0features: Smart Contracts in\u00a0state-channels Oracles and native prediction\u00a0markets Governance by prediction\u00a0markets Written in\u00a0Erlang Different types of\u00a0node Sharding Smart Contracts in\u00a0state-channels A smart contract is a way to execute a contract without an intermediary (middle-man) and without\u00a0conflict. The smart contract is a protocol which is stored and executed on a blockchain, executing transactions (outputs) based on specific inputs and programmable logic automatically. The logic often mirrors that contained in clauses of a written\u00a0contract. State channels are payment networks that exchange funds off-chain and periodically settle up accounts with the main blockchain. (The Bitcoin Lightning Network is creating a system for routing Bitcoin payments through state\u00a0channels.) State channels increase scalability by making groups of transactions independent of each other. This allows them to be processed in\u00a0parallel. \u00e6ternity proposes executing smart-contracts in Turing-complete state channels (Turing complete means, colloquially, real-world and general purpose), which should allow greater volumes of transactions, and make the smart contracts more secure and easier to\u00a0analyse. This is because executing the smart-contracts off-chain makes them private and the code used to execute the smart contract won\u2019t need to be broadcast to the primary blockchain. This should increase processing capacity by allowing contracts to execute in\u00a0parallel. Disadvantages to the state-channel approach include reduced transparency, as running smart contracts in state channels requires more trust in both the contract creator and the node running\u00a0it. Oracles and prediction\u00a0markets The Oracle functionality allows smart-contracts to interact with data outside the \u00e6ternity blockchain. This is possible by checking on-chain prediction market results and rewarding users who made the correct prediction. Users are rewarded through automated payments and the immediate recording of transactions in the blockchain. This creates incentives to participate in prediction markets, which have been shown to be\u00a0effective. On-chain, rather than off-chain allows greater efficiency and\u00a0integration The prediction market is expected to run using a native (on-chain) consensus procedure. The oracle mechanism is designed to use the same consensus\u00a0infrastructure. Governance by prediction\u00a0markets Oracle functionality compliments prediction market\u00a0functionality. Prediction markets are proposed to implement governance of the \u00e6ternity blockchain. This is a new\u00a0approach. The \u00e6ternity protocol would be governed by user input. A prediction market will exist where changes to features and protocols would result in a higher token\u00a0value. The incentive to increase the value of a token (\u00c6on) would allow the \u00e6ternity community to decide efficiently which changes to\u00a0implement. Low level protocol changes to variables like block times and block capacity could be\u00a0possible The consensus developed by the prediction market will initially provide input to the development team\u2019s\u00a0decision-making. Later, a fully autonomous prediction market for governance is expected (a DAO) Written in\u00a0Erlang Erlang is normally used for large-scale systems that manage the allocation of scarce network resources (telecoms, banking, instant\u00a0messaging) Could make it easier to run a lightning network and process many state-channels in\u00a0parallel As far as I know, \u00c6Ternity is the first blockchain project to be written in\u00a0Erlang Different types of\u00a0node The \u00e6ternity network will contain nodes with different functions. Each type of node will contribute towards the efficient functioning of particular aspects of the\u00a0network Node types will\u00a0include Liquidity - Lots of channels and lots of users. Open a channel to issue a contract, for a\u00a0fee. Exchanges - Trustless exchanges of assets offered by market makers. Profitable to market makers because of transaction\u00a0fees. Presumably features such as consensus algorithms and prediction markets will also require their own dedicated node types. Users of the node will incur transaction fees to participate, providing an incentive to run a\u00a0node. Sharding Allows a greater transaction volume, removing scalability problems that Bitcoin and Ethereum have\u00a0experienced. Sharding works by splitting the space of possible accounts into subspaces (for example based on the first digit of a numerical\u00a0address) Each shard gets a set of validators. Each validator validates 1 shard\u00a0only Contracts and transactions within the same shard work as\u00a0normal Contracts and transactions across shards require alternative techniques based on \u201ctransaction\u00a0receipts\u201d"

			"date": "30 April 2017",
 "tags": "fintech, finance, digital currencies, blockchains, dlt, æternity, ico ",			"body": "On April 3rd, I happened to be Googling digital currencies and blockchain innovations when I came across the \u00c6ternity website and skimmed their white paper. The project is ambitious, like many crypto projects, but seems well organised. The team is well known in the space. There is a clear plan to develop the project and create a blockchain technology that, if successful, could bring. A step change in the use of digital currencies for high volume low value transactions, and the viable implementation of smart\u00a0contracts. The ICO To my surprise, I realised that phase 1 of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was about to begin, and if I wanted I could acquire the rights to \u00c6ons (the \u00c6ternity token). During phase 1, 1 ETH would purchase 1100 \u00c6ons. In early April 2017, 1 ETH was worth about\u00a0\u00a338. I was willing to make a small and risky investment, but in order to do that I would need to work out how to convert my conventional Sterling into Bitcoin or Ether, in order to then purchase \u00c6ons. The \u00c6ternity website made it super easy to set up an Etherium wallet, and to use that wallet to invest in the \u00c6ternity project, but buying Ether immediately and putting it in my new wallet proved to be\u00a0challenging. Helpfully, the \u00c6ternity project had partnered with the Swiss firm \u2018Bitcoin Suisse AG\u2019 who would directly convert to \u00c6ons from fiat currencies, cutting out the need to purchase an intermediate digital currency. However once I\u2019d completed the identity checks and signed, scanned and sent the multiple forms, I realised I\u2019d need to pay a \u2018signing on\u2019 fee of about \u00a370. To Bitcoin Suisse\u2019 credit though, they did manually approve my identification and contract within an\u00a0hour. At the time, I thought the project would still be a good investment even with this extra cost, but I determined to exhaust all other possibilities first. I\u2019m familiar with cryptocurrency wallets and public/private keys due to some previous research, so I was able to immediately begin trying to set up an account with an\u00a0exchange. Exchanges What followed was a fairly chaotic few hours where I would sign-up to several exchanges and see how close I could get to purchasing either Bitcoin or Ether immediately, before realising I either had to wait 48 hours for security clearances, or provide additional details, or wait for manual verification of my scanned identity\u00a0documents. By the end of the evening I had a rough idea of which usernames, passwords and (small) sterling amounts had been submitted to each\u00a0exchange. After a couple of false starts, I used a combination of the Coinbase desktop website and their iOS app to purchase ETH up to their weekly limit, and then used multiple cards to increase my holding of ETH. The Coinbase app would bug out when processing a debit card payment and verifying the card details with the bank. This had initially led me to try other exchanges, where I would hit other roadblocks and delays. CEX.IO, for example, doesn\u2019t allow you to make trades in the first 48 hours (IIRC) after registering, which is reasonable enough unless you\u2019re in a\u00a0hurry. Conclusion Once I had a few Ether to my name, the rest of the process was simple. I was delighted to visit Etherscan.io and view the details of my Etherium - \u00c6ternity transactions almost immediately. This gave me a lot of confidence that I hadn\u2019t sent money into a void, and was a nice contrast to my (successful) experience buying bitcoin in early\u00a02014. Finally, the simple tool to check your \u00c6 balance at the bottom of Eternity\u2019s contribution page assured me that I\u2019d made my investment successfully. To me, the \u00c6ternity project stands as an exciting endeavor seeking to solve some widespread and highly valuable technical challenges, I hope they\u2019re successful and wish them\u00a0well."

			"title": "Blogging with\u00a0Pelican",
			"category": "Technical/Web",

			"date": "28 April 2017",
 "tags": "pelican, blog, python, static site ",			"body": "When I began blogging in 2016, I became more aware of how blogs are designed. Many of my favorting blogs had simple designs which made it easier to focus on the content, and they loaded really fast. (E.g. unwiredcouch.com and CuriousGnu). I wanted this for my blog, too. I\u2019d used Wordpress to build and publish my blog which was a great way to begin, but I felt I was compromising on its design and functionality. I wanted to have control over my blog\u2019s\u00a0features. This led me to static sites which contain only fixed content and are faster to load and easier to design than one built using a dynamic blogging platform such as Wordpress. Because I was already familiar with Python I chose Pelican rather than another static site generator such as\u00a0Jekyll. There are plenty of sites to tell you how to start blogging in Pelican, so here I will focus on my experience after the initial set-up. When I was learning how to begin, I found Amy Hanlons blog particularly useful and\u00a0clear. The learning\u00a0curve \u2026 was longer than I expected. Since setting out to switch from Wordpress to Pelican, I\u2019ve taught myself enough of the following tools to hack this site together. I\u2019m really happy about this because these tools could be used in future projects\u00a0too. HTML I find HTML quirky but intuitive. Tags make sense, comments are laborious and learning by google is relatively quick. Whatever it is I\u2019m trying to do (like add a link to jump back to the top of the page) someone will have posted the answer\u00a0somewhere. CSS Writing CSS feels a lot more concise that HTML but it also felt impossible to learn without taking a step back and reading an introductory course. Usually I learn by hacking new phrases together from existing examples so it was frustrating to go backwards before progressing. There was a lightbulb moment when I realised CSS Selectors were a thing, and realising CSS files get called in the header (usually) of an HTML\u00a0file\u2026 I ended up using a trial subscription to Thinkfuls Front-end developer course, which is pretty good at explaining how CSS is structured and how to arrange content on a page. If I still had access, I\u2019d be completing the second half of the course\u00a0:) Jinja\u00a0templates Jinja is a tool written in Python to create HTML pages. It doesn\u2019t look intuitive to me, but I\u2019ve been able to get enough done by copy-pasting similar snippets from other parts of the theme I started with (Thanks Molivier!) to make the changes I wanted. I\u2019d like to learn more as it seems really\u00a0powerful. Pelican To build a website using Pelican, you need to run commands from the terminal. There are various commands but I found myself using only a few regularly. \u201cPelican-quickstart\u201d will generate a project skeleton to get you started. \u201cmake devserver\u201d will initialise a local server and generate output files so that I can view changes locally before uploading (its opposite is \u201cmake stopserver\u201d). Finally \u201cpelican content -s publishconf.py\u201d generates the html and css for remote hosting. Some of the plugins I use such as \u201cAssets\u201d which minifies the CSS only work when publshconf.py is called, which confused me initially as I didn\u2019t think it was working when I was only using \u201cmake\u00a0devserver\u201d. Git This really challenged me, and I still don\u2019t feel like I know what I\u2019m doing. Git is far more powerful than I need it to be, when all I want to do is undo some erroneous edits and upload a new version of the site to\u00a0Github. I can stage and commit files, I can create local and remote repo\u2019s from the command line. I can change a remote\u2019s URL, reset a repo and force a push or a pull. That\u2019s all. I haven\u2019t tried to merge or to create a test branch, and if some part of the process goes wrong it usually takes hours to make it right\u00a0again. This is one tool for which the awesome SO and Google cannot magic up the exact right answer immediatly,\u00a0unfortunately. For example, there is still an output folder in the source repo that is\u2026 mysterious to me. Its not the real output, its a version frozen in time from a few weeks ago, and it has an \u201c@\u201d in its name. I don\u2019t know how it got there. It was created one afternoon in a blur of frustrated google queries and copy/paste/hope terminal\u00a0commands. I find git\u2019s commands the least intuitive of all the tools I use, with its preceeding single dashes and double dashes, and random words thrown into the middle of otherwise reasonable\u00a0commands. But Git is ubiquitous and Github is awesome, so I will learn\u00a0it. Github pages with an external URL You\u2019ll need to add a file called CNAME to the repo containing the output. CNAME should contain the address of your site in lowercase.\u00a0Simple. You\u2019ll also need to update the DNS records of your domain name to point the name at Github\u2019s servers. For Github, you need two \u201cA Records\u201d with host type \u201c@\u201d and values \u201c192.30.252.153\u201d and \u201c192.30.252.154\u201d respectively. You also need a CNAME record with host type \u201cwww\u201d and the value equal to \u201cusername.github.io\u201d. It took about 12 hours for the changes to propagate, and during that time I had variable success loading the\u00a0site. Plugins One thing I didn\u2019t want when moving away from Wordpress was a site bloated with features that didn\u2019t make the content easier to read. However I found I still needed a few plugins to optimise my site and provide some basic functionality that doesn\u2019t come with the vanilla\u00a0Pelican. iPython\u00a0notebooks Super useful, as all I need to do to publish a notebook as a webpage is copy the .ipynb file into the context directory and add a sidecar .ipynb-meta file with standard meta data. This functionality is one of the main reasons why Pelican is popular with data bloggers. (Though Nikola is another\u00a0option). Neighbors At the end of a post there should be a link to the previous and next blog posts - I was surprised this wasn\u2019t included as standard. After putting the plugin in the plugins folder and updating pelicanconf.py, you need to copy a couple of jinja snippets into a template, and maybe add some css to make the links look\u00a0nice. Optimise\u00a0images Make those images as small as possible to help make the site as fast as possible. Add the plugin, update pelicanconf.py, and thats\u00a0all. Assets Before I started working with Pelican, minifying css and JavaScript would have been too advanced. But once Pingdom and Google Pagespeed started criticising me for my multiple .css files, I accepted the\u00a0challenge. Conclusion I\u2019m super happy wth the websites design and speed. It\u2019s designed the way I want it, and I\u2019ve learnt a ton of useful stuff along the\u00a0way. Update: My second post about blogging in Pelican is here."

 "tags": "doctorate, granular flow, granular materials, phd, research, engineering, silo, thesis, vienna ",			"body": "Background From Spring 2010 until the Autumn of 2013, I was a PhD candidate living in Vienna, Austria and working at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences. Before working in Vienna, I completed my Masters degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of\u00a0Edinburgh. My research quantified the effects of changing the amount of gravity acting on granular materials as they poured out of a\u00a0silo. My PhD thesis and the short presentation I used when I defended\u00a0it. Granular materials are a broad class of materials that are encountered everyday - salt, pills, breakfast cereal, sand, rice, soil, landslides, salt are all granular materials. They are ubiquitous and occur in many different sizes and\u00a0varieties. Silos are a common type of container for storing granular materials. You pour the granular material in from the top, store it for a while, and then dispense the material in controlled quantities from the\u00a0bottom. Research\u00a0focus My research focussed on quantifying how changes in gravity affected the material contained inside a silo, particularly whilst the silo was being emptied. This is pertinent because engineers and scientists do not yet have a scientific understanding of how granular materials behave. Whilst gravity clearly affects a granular materials, we cannot say exactly\u00a0how. This means we can\u2019t use analytical methods to quantify the physics that occur in a real system. Instead we use empirical methods (approximations, guesses, rules-of-thumb, and knowledge of what worked in previous similar situations). This isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but it is less efficient and less reliable than an analytical\u00a0approach. Research\u00a0techniques Physical\u00a0modelling I built a small model silo (30cm tall) and put it into quite a large centrifuge (3 metre diameter). By rotating the model silo around the centre of the centrifuge at a constant speed I could simulate a higher gravity. I added high-speed cameras, pressure sensors and weighing scales so that I could measure how the material was moving once I opened the silo outlet and the silo began to empty. Photos of the experimental model I built can be seen\u00a0below. Numerical\u00a0modelling I also programmed a computer model (using the commercial PFC 3D software and working in the FISH scripting language) to simulate and investigate if the same behaviours could be observed numerically as\u00a0physically. The class of computer model I used is known as DEM (Discrete Element Modelling). These models work by considering every grain of material individually, usually as a sphere. If one sphere overlaps with another (i.e. the distance between the two particle centres is less than the sum of their radiuses) then a force proportional to the overlap size repels the two spheres away from each other. This simple approach is repeated over every grain or particle in the model, and produces life like behaviour in many situations. It has many advantages over \u201ccontinuum\u201d based techniques that model groups of grains as if they were all just one big particle with unusual properties. DEM has one massive limitation, though. It requires huge amounts of computational resources - and this limits its use in industrial scenarios outside. Until computers become much, much more powerful, DEM will only be used for theoretical research and niche\u00a0applications. Results When gravity increases by a factor of \\(x\\), both the discharge rate and local velocities within the silo increase by \\(\\sqrt(x)\\)\u00a0. That\u2019s good to know if you\u2019re planning on storing stuff on the moon, but it\u2019s also a useful step towards explaining exactly why bulk granular materials behave the way they\u00a0do.

 "tags": "encryption, rsa, dlt, blockchains, bitcoin, digital currencies, public key cryptography ",			"body": "Blockchains use Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) to authenticate users and authorise transactions. These notes introduce the field of cryptography and explains how modern cryptographic methods work. I wrote them to teach myself about encryption 1 To begin with the absolute basics, encryption generally works by taking a message and representing it as a series of numbers 2 which are then turned into a series of random looking numbers. Decryption works by turning the random looking numbers back into the original\u00a0message. Background The history of Cryptography can be split into classical and modern eras. Modern cryptography began in 1977 with the introduction of the RSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithms. Until then, Cryptography required using a single key (the secret code) to encrypt and decrypt the message. This was transferred from sender to receiver secretly, but not cryptographically. In classical cryptography, the code is a shared\u00a0secret. The modern era removed the requirement for a shared secret and instead used number theory as a basis for quantifying the strength of an encryption method. The strength of a modern cryptographic technique is quantifiable and provable by reference to number theory, rather than a users ability to transport or transfer a secret\u00a0code. Modern cryptography is defined by Public Key Cryptographic systems. They use one key (code) for encryption and another for decryption. The encryption key can be made public without any risk of the message being decrypted, and is therefore known as the public key. The key used to decrypt data is the private key, and must not be revealed. If a message is encrypted with the public key it can only be decrypted with the private\u00a0key. Public Key Cryptographic (PKC) systems use algorithms that are easy to process in one direction but difficult to reverse, which are known as mathematical trap-door functions. A simple example of a trap-door function is the product of two prime numbers. If two random prime numbers are chosen, it is trivial to find their product. However if only the product of the two numbers is known, it is relatively difficult to find either of the factors used to create the number (this is factorisation). This was first noticed in 1874, when Jevons\u00a0remarked: \u201cCan the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8,616,460,799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever\u00a0know.\u201d* This simple problem shows that finding the product of two (secret) prime numbers is computationally simple, but factorising the result is not. This type of problem is a key feature of modern cryptography. Factoring prime numbers is a super famous mathematical problem, it was studied by Eratosthenes 3 in the 3rd century BC and more recently the RSA Factoring Challenge has intended to track state-of-the-art factorisation techniques by issues cash prizes for the factorisation of products of large\u00a0primes. Generally, the bigger the difference in difficulty between executing the function and reversing it, the better the cryptographic\u00a0technique. The RSA algorithm below uses factorisation as the foundation of its security, but factorisation is not the hardest problem to solve relative to the size of the keys required. Algorithms have been developed to factor the products of large prime numbers, and are much more efficient than randomly guessing possible factors. The greater the size of the primes being factored, the more efficient these algorithms become, and therefore the difference in difficulty between executing the function (multiplying two large primes) and reversing it (factorisation) becomes smaller as the size of the cryptographic key length increases. This is a problem because as public key cryptography becomes more commonly used the resources available to factor products of primes increases, and consequently larger keys are\u00a0required. Ultimately, encryption techniques based on the difficulty of factorisation will become redundant as the difficulty gap between creating and solving them shrinks. A better trap door function is\u00a0required. Overview of the RSA\u00a0algorithm Named after its founders (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), RSA was one of the first public-key encryption algorithms and is still widely\u00a0used. RSA (as well as other cryptographic techniques) makes use of a number line which loops back to zero after reaching a maximum value, rather than increasing indefinitely. This means that once a maximum number \\(n\\) has been defined, if a number greater than \\(n\\) is created the result simply loops around to 0 and begins counting from 0 again. i.e. if \\(n = 10\\), then \\(7 + 5 = 12 - 10 = 2\\). The result of a calculation on a looping number line may easily be found by doing long division and using the remainder as the final answer, i.e. \\(12 / 10 = 1\\) with \\(2\\)\u00a0remaining. Generation of a pair of RSA\u00a0keys: 1. Generate the RSA\u00a0module Select two large random prime numbers, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). They need to be random because anyone who knows or guesses them will be able to decrypt the\u00a0encryption. Calculate \\(n =\u00a0pq\\) 2. Find derived number\u00a0(e) e must be greater than 1 and less than \\(( p - 1)( q - 1)\\). There must be no common factor for e and \\(( p - 1)( q - 1)\\) except for 1. 4 3. Form the public\u00a0key The pair of numbers \\((n, e)\\) form the public key and can be made\u00a0public. Even though \\(n\\) is public, it is so difficult to factor the product of 2 large prime numbers that an attacker would not be able to find its component primes in the time available. The strength of RSA rests entirely on the difficulty of factoring \\(n\\) into its two component prime\u00a0numbers. 4. Generate the private key\u00a0(d) The private key is generated from using \\(p\\), \\(q\\) and e as inputs to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. For a given set of values, there is a unique answer \\(d\\). \\(d\\) is the inverse of \\(e\\) modulo \\(( p - 1)( q - 1 )\\). This means that \\(d\\) is the number less than \\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\\) such that when it is multiplied by e, it is equal to \\(1\\) modulo \\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\\). RSA\u00a0example: RSA does not directly operate on strings as bits, it operates on numbers modulo (less than) \\(n\\). and it is necessary to represent plain text as a series of numbers less than \\(n\\). The dominant encoding on the internet is UTF-8, which represents each upper case Latin letter as a number between 65 and 90. Using this encoding, a message \u201cHELLO\u201d would become \u201c\\(72, 69, 76, 76, 79\\)\u201d. The maximum number \\(n\\) needs to be the product of the two prime numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). For this example choose \\(p = 7\\) and \\(q = 13\\), so \\(n = 91\\) 5 The public key component e can be any number we choose, as long as there is no number other than 1 which is a common factor of e and \\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\\). In our example, this requires that there be no common factor between 72 and e other than 1, so let e \\(= 5\\). Therefore our public key is (91, 5). This can be made available to anyone without messages being decrypted because of the difficulty of factoring the product of (very large) prime\u00a0numbers. Using the fact that we know 5 and 11 are the prime factors of 55 and e is 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute our private key \\(d\\), which is\u00a029. Therefore when the prime factors 7 and 13 are used, the public key is (91, 5) and the private key is (91, 29). These parameters fully define a functional RSA\u00a0system. Encoding To encode a letter H in a message (\u2018H\u2019 is \\(72\\) in UTF-8), we need to multiply it by itself \\(e\\) times (\\(e = 5\\)), remembering to wrap around each time we pass our maximum value of \\(n = 91\\). \\(72 \\times 72 = 5184, 5184 / 91 = 56\\) with \\(88\\) remaining, (i.e. \\(5184 = 91 \\times 56 + 88\\)). Therefore: \\(72 \\times 72 = 5184 = 88\\) \\(88 \\times 72 = 6336 = 57\\) \\(57 \\times 72 = 4104 = 9\\) \\(9 \\times 72 = 648 =\u00a011\\) Therefore the encrypted value of \u201cH\u201d is \u201c\\(11\\)\u201c Using the method for each character in the message \u201cHELLO\u201d results in the encoded message \u201c\\\\(11,62,20,20,53\\\\)\u201d. To decrypt the message, we take each number and multiply it by itself \\(d\\) times, (\\(d=29\\)) wrapping around each time we pass \\(91\\). \\(11 \\times 11 = 121 = 30\\) \\(30 \\times 11 = 330 = 57\\) \u2026 \\(57 \\times 11 = 627 = 81\\) \\(81 \\times 11 = 891 =\u00a072\\) And we\u2019re back to our original\u00a0encoding. Files The spreadsheet I used to calculate the encrypted and decrypted values can be downloaded here. A simple python script to encrypt and decrypt a message is here. It uses the AES encryption\u00a0method. Footnotes I used the explanations here and here a lot.\u00a0\u21a9 A simple example is \\(A=1, B=2\\) etc\u00a0\u21a9 Eratosthenes invented his famous sieving algorithm which finds all the primes up to a given limit.\u00a0\u21a9 If this is the case then e and ( p - 1) ( q - 1 ) are called \u201ccoprime\u201d\u00a0\u21a9 Whilst the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is apparently simple to compute, its description is not.

 "tags": "bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, cryptography, digital currencies, finance, fintech ",			"body": "Digital currencies are often discussed in the context of finance, technology and economics. The Blockchain - the technology which applications like Bitcoin are built on - is significant because it removes the need for trust or an intermediary between unrelated parties transacting with each other. So far, the most influential and famous digital currency is\u00a0Bitcoin. This post is intended to introduce the basic concepts of digital currencies and the problems a distributed ledger system needs to\u00a0overcome. What is a digital\u00a0currency? A digital currency is an internet based medium of exchange. Units of digital currency are not printed, are not physical, and represent nothing. A unit of currency is produced by running algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a unit of currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin) is\u00a0generated. If the currency represents nothing, why is it\u00a0valuable? Because people believe that in future, other people will believe it does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for\u00a0it. This is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies) which also don\u2019t represent anything physical. (Although these examples are supported by laws or\u00a0regulation). In the past, creating a new currency without the support of government hasn\u2019t been practical\u00a0because: A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new currency (otherwise people would create counterfeit currency, decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards\u00a0zero) An intermediary (a bank) was required for all large or remote transactions, to make sure that the amount of money each party owns is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventing double spending of\u00a0funds) The technological breakthrough was preventing double spending without requiring an intermediary. This is made possible by using cryptographic techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful computers which have only recently become\u00a0available. Central and distributed\u00a0ledgers With conventional currencies everyone\u2019s balance and transactions are recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much money each account has) and each account holder only has access to their own balance and transactions. With digital currencies, a copy of the entire ledger (every transaction ever made by everyone) is held on each computer (or node), and anyone can see everyone\u2019s\u00a0transactions. Conventionally, if two parties wish to make a remote transaction then they need a bank to be the intermediary. The bank mediates by updating the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds as a result of the transaction. This is how one party knows if the counter-party is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must be involved in every transaction between its account holders. This need for an intermediary increases the complexity and cost of doing\u00a0business. Sending\u00a0money To send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in your account should decrease and the amount in another account should increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this message will check its authenticity, make the changes, and pass the message along to other\u00a0nodes. What problems does blockchain\u00a0solve? For a transaction to be accepted and entered into the distributed ledger, its authenticity needs to be verified. Because the ledger is distributed, everyone can see everyone else\u2019s transactions. Therefore user authentication and transaction authorisation needs to be possible without compromising a user\u2019s ability to send secure payments in\u00a0future. There is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is neither physical, printed or representative of anything, how do you prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply creating as much new currency as they\u00a0want? Another problem is the addition of new transactions to the ledger from many unrelated users. If each party has their own copy of the ledger, updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers completeness and accuracy be assured? How would you update your ledger to take account of transactions between third parties, and how would you know the order in which they occurred?1 The blockchain is remarkable because it is the first technology to solve all of these problems. Future posts will consider each of these problems are\u00a0overcome. This is the Byzantine Generals problem, which is nicely described in the introduction of this paper\u00a0\u21a9"

 "tags": "habits, advice, reflection ",			"body": "This is a list of interests I want to consider pursuing. I wrote it when I began to study for my last set of exams and my mind filled with things I\u2019d rather be doing instead. Some of these interests are just me reacting to having no spare time for a few months, but others are decent goals and projects. Temporarily losing my spare time made me value it\u00a0more. I wrote this post so that I could compare what I thought was important when I was busy to when I wasn\u2019t. Writing the list allowed me to move on without forgetting. Here\u2019s a break down of each\u00a0item: \u201cRun 10k in 50 minutes\u201d - This is easier than I imagined. When I wrote the list I could barely run 2k without stopping, but intended to go for a weekly run whilst studying. I\u2019ve struggled to stay energetic and healthy during previous exam phases, so now I have a rule that I must do some mild exercise even if I think I can\u2019t spare the time. I find running really lowers my stress levels, and increasing my heart rate and working up a sweat lets me sleep better and concentrate for longer. After a few weeks of minimal running, I could run 5k easily. If I kept at it, 10k in 50 mins would be easy. But point\u00a02\u2026 \u201cBe Insanity strong\u201d - As in, do the Insanity workout programme. Again. I thought about it and decided to do P90x instead. Week 1 is going\u00a0great. \u201cRead the bible habitually\u201d - When I was 17 I found out about Jesus and became a Christian. In the months and years after that I\u2019d regularly read my bible almost every day and pray a lot. I wanted to understand, so I set a goal of 5 chapters each\u00a0day. I read through the new testament repeatedly and read most of the old testament during this time. I knew the scriptures well enough that a lot of sermons became boring and obvious - I\u2019d already studied the bible passage being used. During this time I remember being aware that the way I thought was different to how it would have been otherwise. My perspectives were long-term and less me focused. I thought about what I was reading instead of the days\u2019 headlines or social chatter. I remember enjoying the benefits and thinking that I should keep this habit. The reasons why I think Christianity is so wonderful are well summarised in this sermon. It\u2019s now 10 years later, and whilst my convictions are strong, my knowledge of the bible is sadly pretty fuzzy. My thinking is clouded by the perspectives contained in the media I consume and the conversations I\u2019m part of. I strongly suspect I would be acting and thinking differently if I read my bible more, but I don\u2019t know what those differences would be. Trouble is, it\u2019s often not obvious what the immediate benefits of reading the bible are, you have to work for it a bit. Praying for help is effective. The books in the bible were written to last through the ages and across all cultures, so it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re not as easy to read as something written for an English speaker in a hurry. I should stop being in a hurry, and stop prioritising only quantifiable\u00a0goals. \u201cThink more\u201d - On a similar note to 3, but less supernatural. If I spent less time consuming content and a little more looking around me or walking, I reckon I\u2019d be more self-aware and make better decisions. This would probably lead to a happier, more satisfying\u00a0life. \u201cPray more\u201d - I don\u2019t know why, but the creator of the universe wants me to talk and share my life with him. He cares about me. This makes no sense to me, at all. If I was God, I would not go out of my way to consider the views and concerns of a very flawed human. But when I pray, my prayers are very often answered. I should ask him about\u00a0this. \u201cAmazon seller?\u201d - Amazon have this \u201cFulfilled by Amazon\u201d service, which means you don\u2019t even need to hold the stock you want to sell. If I choose the right products, import them cheaply from China and reselling them on Amazon at a profit, I end up quids in for minimal effort and manageable risk. Sounds\u00a0intriguing. \u201cBlog about interesting data\u201d - Here I am, blogging. I should stick to the main topic and get technical. I was inspired by this blog in\u00a0particular. \u201cFinish Coursera\u201d - The data science specialization is great! It\u2019s in R, and I want to focus on Python, but I\u2019d still like to do it. I need to consider the opportunity cost of the time committed,\u00a0though. \u201cRead for fun, history, fiction\u201d - When I started my job, in April 2014, I was half way through Savage Continent, which is an eye-opening and eye-watering history of Europe in the years after World War 2. I see Europe through different eyes because of it. However I only got half way though, and since April \u201814 I never felt I had the free time or energy to pick it back up. This should change. When I was a researcher, and when I was a student, I had so much more opportunity to develop my own pursuits. Since entering the corporate world, I find myself fighting a war of attrition to exert my personality onto my\u00a0lifestyle. Read for fiction\u2026 I\u2019m unconvinced. What do you have at the end of it? What can you do with it? Maybe I\u2019ve just been reading the wrong authors, but I\u2019m going to leave this for now. Sure, you could gain an appreciation of a different time or place, but that appreciation comes via the fictional characters and events, its secondary. What about abstract constructs, perspectives, morals\u2026 things that history books are ill-suited for? Great fiction would be essential for exploring these. But for now, I\u2019ll prioritise point\u00a03. \u201cDo a photography project\u201d - This I would love to do, but probably won\u2019t. It would be a luxury, and the opportunity cost would be too great right now. I\u2019d like to shoot a series of black and white portraits, and turn them into large prints. I think good portrait photography is uniquely impactful and moving, choosing B\u0026W removes distractions and leaves a subjects humanity more\u00a0exposed. \u201cHave a list of business/product ideas\u201d - There\u2019s no excuse for this one, anyone can have several good ideas. It\u2019s turning them into reality that takes skill. Need to have the ideas first,\u00a0though. \u201cDo a law MOOC\u201d - i.e Study particular areas of law, in my own time and at my own pace. I studied a tiny bit of law during the ACA, and realised employment law or contract law could be really useful. (Same for the tax system - another surprise). We only had a brief introduction though, so if I could find the time I\u2019d like to know\u00a0more. \u201cDo an InfoSec or Network Security MOOC\u201d - Its super interesting, but not likely to be a good use of\u00a0time. \u201cLearn to fight - Krav Maga / MMA\u201d - Ever since watching The Bourne Identity I\u2019ve wanted to learn Krav Maga, and Georges St-Pierre made me want to train for MMA. For now though, I\u2019ll do P90x. I can reconsider in 90\u00a0days. \u201cGet out of London\u201d - My contract ends in April 2017, next summer will be a crossroads. I hate the commute, I hate being constantly rushed. Living in other cities has been a lot more\u00a0pleasant."

 "tags": "applescript, coffeescript, javascript, time until, übersicht, widgets ",			"body": "In a previous post I described how I was introduced to CoffeeScript via \u00dcbersicht, the desktop widget app for OS X, and eventually published the \u201cTime Since\u201d\u00a0widget. Seeing a few people download the widget was really satisfying, and I was soon wondering what else I could publish. As a pragmatic engineer, it seemed clear to me what the next widget should do: If my first widget calculated the time since an event, the next should calculate the time until an event. I set out to create the companion to \u201cTime Since\u201d and improve upon the underlying\u00a0code. My first code design choice was to cut out the use of an Apple Script and calculated everything in one CoffeeScript file. It would be more efficient and easier to\u00a0read. Unfortunately I soon began to realise why the original widget I\u2019d based \u201cTime Since\u201d on had used AppleScript to calculate the time elapsed. Date-Times are fiddly to work with in many languages, and this is true in JavaScript\u00a0also. My code began to look increasingly like spaghetti as I tried to achieve 6 key\u00a0features: Calculate the number of months and days between two dates (complicated by the varying number of days in different\u00a0months) Add the option to specify the level of detail in the output text (to the minute, to the hour, to the day,\u00a0etc.) Remove any 0 amounts from the output (\u201c2 Months and 5 Hours\u201d not \u201c2 Months, 0 Days and 5\u00a0Hours\u201d) Add the option to abbreviate times (\u2018years\u2019 \u2192 \u2018y\u2019, \u2018hours\u2019 \u2192 \u2018h\u2019, \u2018and\u2019 \u2192 \u2018\u0026\u2019,\u00a0etc.) Output a grammatically correct sentence (correct pluralisation and comma separated terms, with an \u201cand\u201d between the last two\u00a0terms) Prepend and append users defined\u00a0strings After a few frustrating hours, it was clear that it would be a lot easier to modify the existing AppleScript rather than reinvent the wheel in JavaScript. I decided to use it instead of using only JavaScript as I knew the AppleScript file could correctly consider the number of days in the months between the 2 dates (feature 1), and it contains a function to pluralise the correct parts of the string (feature\u00a05). The remaining features were added by using a combination of if statements and arrays. The if statements simply ask if an amount is equal to zero. If not, then it\u2019s appended to an array of terms to include in the output. At the end of this code chunk it\u2019s possible to ask how many non-zero terms to include in the output. An array with length one less than the number of output terms is created and filled with commas with an \u2018and\u2019 in the final\u00a0position. The two arrays are combined in the correct order by looping through the index of the longer array and appending each term to a final array. The final array is the\u00a0output. \u2018Time Until\u2018 can be downloaded from the \u00dcbersicht widgets gallery. I think another useful feature would be an option to specify the output only in terms of a chosen amount, such as weeks or days. Maybe I\u2019ll do that in the\u00a0future."

One of the biggest time sinks (for me) when working with these tools (ACL, SQL, Python) is debugging, and working out exactly where in the chain of individual commands something unexpected happened. Even with only a modest page of code, I can quickly find myself rerunning the entire script multiple times and commenting-out and uncommenting multiple lines in order to understand what\u2019s really going on. If you have a time consuming task at the start of your script, such as a summarise and sort command, the extra time required can be even greater. This leads to interrupted flow and\u00a0concentration. Pandas is a python package to manipulate large datasets, the Jupyter notebook is an application which allows the user to run a python script in chunks, and output the results of each chunk before continuing. You can re-run a previous chunk without returning to the beginning, and change the code as you go along. This is amazingly flexible and\u00a0intuitive.

The main downside to me is that the courses exclusively use R (which is popular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more popular in\u00a0Industry). Each course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data science, such as statistical inference or machine learning. Key concepts and tools in each subject are explained and developed, and whilst it\u2019s not as thorough as a longer course would be, there is more than enough material packed into the lectures, quizzes, assignments and projects to apply to real\u00a0applications.

I then added some extra features\u00a0including: Optional text before and after the elapsed\u00a0time Choice of expanded or abbreviated display\u00a0styles Flexible formatting to remove and zero\u00a0amounts The widget is called \u201cTime Since\u201d and is in the \u00dcbersicht widgets gallery."
