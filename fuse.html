If you look on the Pelican plugins index you\u2019ll see that Tipue search is the only search tool with a ready-made Pelican plugin, but unfortunat the project seems to have died and the projects website is now But searching a static site must be quite a common need and googling for alternativ gave me a few choices. Lunr.js seems to be the most popular, but it also seemed fairly complicate and like it was probably more than I needed. I went with Tiny Search because it seemed to do what I needed and was easy to setup. There\u2019s even an example for Pelican\u00a0bl One hurdle to success was minimising the false positives. The default settings seem to prioritise keeping the size of the index small (tiny) over giving a good user experience Maybe its because the amount of text on my site is significan less, or more, than the typical use case. Either way, after checking the project\u2019s issues on Github I found an issue that matched my problem perfectly. The solution is to increase the tiny_magic variable at build\u00a0time According to the Readme, this requires using a container and building the index using docker run.... Unfortunat the Dockerfile wouldn\u2019t complete without errors. Checking the issues again and adding to the discussion resulted in an alternativ Dockerfile being suggested, which works. Woohoo! I could then build the search index with a massive tiny_magic value\u00a0(204 Then something weird happened. I write in Vim and I use fzf to find and open files. I realised that fzf had stopped working. After some investigat I realised it was only not working in the blog project, and that fzf.vim calls the fzf CLI tool, which in turn calls the ripgrep tool. The underlying issue was that ripgrep wasn\u2019t working, and after a few hours (sob) of debugging, I found out that one of the things that makes rg special is that it ignores stuff in your .gitignore file. Sneakily, and without me noticing, the Docker image for constructi the tinysearch files had created a .gitignore file with a single entry. The entry was *, which selects everything So rg was ignoring everything and giving no results. Which meant I couldn\u2019t find and open\u00a0files I still don\u2019t know how (or which part of) the Dockerfile does this, so I\u2019ve created a file which contains the correct content, and after I generate a new search index I replace the new traitorous .gitignore with the contents of I\u2019ll come back to it later when/if I have a better understand of Dockerfile syntax, or\u00a0Rust. Adding search to the site made the content feel a lot closer and more accessible Once it was working I immediatel wanted to use some keyboard shortcuts to open the search box and select results. Kind of like does it. It feels really fast and\u00a0precis Googling for some jquery packages, and also some vanilla javaScript showed me enough to get things working. You can hit / or ctrl-k or cmd-k and bring up a search box that populates results as you\u00a0type! Only whole words are matched unfortunat but its still a super useful feature.

Cardano wallets are generated using a parameter called The default value is 20, and is the number of unused addresses that the node will generate and return to a client using the REST API. If one of the addresses is used, the node will automatica generate another so that there are always 20 This is probably very convenient for personal use. If I want someone to send me some funds, I can make a simple api call using cURL and get a fresh address. But if you are running a service, weather its e-commerce or a financial service, its not really good enough. Some advice on the forums says to generate a wallet with a very large value such as 10,000 and just generate a new wallet when you run out of fresh addresses, but it still feels like a\u00a0compromi But lets explain our situation in more detail first. If a customer wants to send us some ADA, we want to give them a fresh address that\u2019s never been used before and that only they have. Then we know that any funds that arrive to that address are from a particular customer. However we don\u2019t know if the customer will actually use the address and transfer any funds. The address might remain unused or it might not. Neverthele that address is now reserved for them, and no one else can use\u00a0it. In this way, we might need to generate and maintain a list of thousands of addresses that are never used. Using for this seems like a bad\u00a0soluti Fortunatel has the answer, albeit in a fairly convoluted and obscured form. If you have the mnemonic that was used to generate a wallet originally you can generate 2^31 unique addresses like\u00a0so: Clone the repo and build the docker\u00a0ima git clone docker build -t .

Unlike Polkadot or Cardano, I\u2019m not going to run it from a container until it\u2019s working reliably. The Binance docs show a couple of ways to install a node. I used the install.sh script and went with default values as much as possible. Installati My first attempts to sync a full node used the install.sh script, but the node wouldn\u2019t sync completely it would get stuck. I setup a new VM and did a manual install (\u201cOption Two\u201d) and so far the node has been syncing without any issues. You need to download the genesis file separately in this case. Also, be sure to download the node-binar repo using git lfs and not just git. It will look like it worked but bnbchaind wont have completely downloaded unless you use lfs It took me awhile to realise that the documentat assumes that you have an environmen variable called BNCHOME. You can either create it using export (like you would for any environmen variable) or replace the environmen variable in the start node command with the file path: nohup bnbchaind start --home BNCHOME & Note: I\u2019m not sure if the bnbchaind needs the environmen variable to be set or not. It doesn\u2019t give errors if it isn\u2019t set, but I seem to be having more success when BNCHOME is defined. Syncing the node There are three ways to sync a node. Fast-sync isn\u2019t the fastest way to sync your node, hot-sync is. Using install.sh should put the correct default values in the file, but I needed to adjust ping_inter and pong_timeo to the recommende values. Surprises The documentat assumes you have familiarit with running tasks in the background of a terminal session, and that you\u2019re familiar with nohup.

I logged in this morning expecting to see a completed download, but realised I only had half the\u00a0file. Use nohup to ignore HUP signals One solution to this seems to be to use nohup, a command that ignores the HUP signal. It stops your programme from stopping if the terminal session its running in is\u00a0stopped By convention the HUP signal is the method used by a terminal to warn dependent processes that it is about to\u00a0logout. You probably want to run nohup in the background You might want to prevent it from creating nohup.out. Close or redirect fd0 -\u00a0fd2 On Linux, if you run a command with nohup then nohup automatica closes stdin. If you\u2019re using MacOS or BSD this doesn\u2019t automatica happen, so you might want to redirect it yourself. This is because if a background process tries to read anything from stdin then it will pause itself and wait for you to bring it to the foreground fg and type some input. This is probably a waste of\u00a0time. If nohup detects that you have redirected stdout and stderr then it won\u2019t create nohup.out. As with all commands, if you put & at the end of the command, it will run in the background You can bring it to the foreground by running fg, or see a list of jobs by running jobs. If you redirect input to /dev/null by </dev/null you will stop the program from receiving keyboard (stdin) input, but you won\u2019t prevent it from accessing the terminal directly. Also you haven\u2019t removed the program from the shell\u2019s process\u00a0gr Stopping signals using disown If you want to remove a program from the shell\u2019s process group, then immediatel after you\u2019ve run the command to start your programme, run disown with no arguments. This will make the background process no longer associated with the shell job and it wont have any signals forwarded to it by the\u00a0shell. A disowned process gets nothing (no signals) sent to it by the shell. But without a nohup it will still be sent a HUP signal sent via other means, such as a manual kill command. A nohuped process will ignore any and all HUP signal, no matter how they are\u00a0sent.

It\u2019s going to make things harder for a while before things get easier. You\u2019ll find difficult answers that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t. If you\u2019re only concerned with the present then its true that ignorance is bliss, but otherwise it\u2019s a liability. \u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d is another good question to ask a lot. Adapt to the situation, don\u2019t make it adapt to you if you have any choice. Be kind of like water, going around things and through the gaps. Look for the edges and the gaps, the parts that aren\u2019t well known. Let people talk as much as they want to. Shut up and listen. If they mean you harm or don\u2019t respect you then it\u2019ll become more obvious the more they keep talking. If they mean you well or they\u2019re saying something useful, you will benefit more from letting them talk more. Inversion - it can be hard to know if you should do something, but how would you feel if you didn\u2019t do it, or if it didn\u2019t happen? Regrets are inevitable everyone has them. Same as making mistakes. Let your regrets be for things that you did do, and not what you didn\u2019t do. If you are willing to try something, fail at it, and still be glad that you tried, then you should almost definitely do it. Commit to it and enjoy the experience Don\u2019t be scared, or at least, be scared and optimistic and happy2. There is beauty and luxury in being in such a bad spot that you are backed into a corner with seemingly no way out.

My resources were smaller and things could quickly flip from good to bad. Enjoy the few benefits that a situation like that gives, because (hopefully once its gone its gone for good.

At the moment our attention is controlled by other threats. I am concerned that a lot of money has been injected into the money supply but we haven\u2019t seen any inflation, and I am concerned that the price of stocks is no longer driven by the business fundamenta of the company, but by macro economics. It is a terrible time to be a value investor, and that is alarming. Value investing should always be a decent way to make money, unless the markets are broken. If the price of something doesn\u2019t represent its value, then a correction is inevitable Interest rates are really low at the moment, so if you have spare money and you want to make it work for you then where do you put it? Not into a bank account, because interest rates are low1, and not into government debt, because the yield is so low. It has to be stocks if you want the value of your investment to increase meaningful But everyone is doing this which drives the price up, and because their price is increasing they excel even further. I think that the main reason for concern is super low interest rates and massive increases in the money supply, but there are a couple of other factors that are also contributi It\u2019s easier than ever for retail investors to participat in the stock market, and this seems like a good idea. However if retail investors have influence to effect prices, and they themselves can be manipulate or influenced regarding what or when they buy or sell, then that is likely a new kind of threat to financial stability. We\u2019ve never seen social media combined with quick, cheap investment services for amateurs before. Index funds are also more popular than ever2 - the efficacy of index investing relative to traditiona funds that use stock pickers is very high over medium or long time horizons because index funds are much cheaper. But if index funds become too large then they end up influencin the market in predictabl and rigid ways. Index funds cannot choose what they buy or how much they buy - they just track the index. If a company\u2019s stock crosses certain thresholds their stock has to be bought or sold. It seems like its possible to create feedback loops where funds have to buy more of a rising stock, which increases its scarcity and price, which then requires index funds to purchase more of the same stock. The amount of euros in existence in 2019 was 90% more than in 2010.3 But inflation between 2010 and 2020 is 13%.4 Why is that? If the price of something doesn\u2019t represent its value, then a correction is inevitable are interest rates low? Because confidence in the economy is low, so central bankers have to lower interest rates to make it 1. Cheaper for a business to borrow money to invest in their business and therefore easier for a business investment to be profitable and 2. So that its more attractive for investors to use their capital to invest in a business (which grows the economy) relative to depositing spare cash in a bank account (which is safer but a less efficient way to deploy capital).

I use the plugin to: add subcategor assign multiple categories to articles. Subcategor aren\u2019t working and Pelican thinks each article just has categories than contain forward slashes. In his \u201cpowerful python\u201d emails, Aaron Maxwell recommends looking at the source code for popular python libraries to see how really good Python is written, and how talented developers write code and solve problems. This is a good opportunit to look at the code that powers the plugin and see if if I can: Understand the source code Locate the source of the problem Fix the problem I don\u2019t know if Pelican is amazingly good quality or not, I get the feeling it could do with more developer resources, but I\u2019ve got a real reason and motivation to look at the underlying code so I\u2019m going to give it a shot. The documentat is sparse which doesn\u2019t help, I get the impression that whoever wrote it feels like Pelican is simple and it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s going on 1. It\u2019s not obvious to me. Pelican Plugins Every plugin has to have a register() function, here it is for the plugin: def register() I understand the idea of signals from Django, and generators are discussed a bit in the documentat So what else is happening\u2026 As I write down my understand of the plugin, I\u2019m aware that my understand is definitely incomplete and probably wrong. I hope that as I progress I will see the mistakes in what I\u2019ve already written. is called first, and it takes two arguments, generator and metadata. The entire function is 3 lines so here it is: def metadata): categories = = for name in categories = It looks like it gets the category from the metadata for each article. Presumably by the time this function is called the articles have already been parsed and a metadata object has already been created and populated with metadata about the articles, including categories The first row of splits up the categories if multiple categories are listed. metadata must be a dictionary and there must be a metadata dict for each article, otherwise you couldn\u2019t just get get the value assoiciate with the dictionary key and then split the string on commas. This means that this function is called once for each article. I don\u2019t know what text_type does yet. Maybe it ensures that the output is always a string. It\u2019s imported from six which I remember seeing being a dependecy of some other packages. .. Having checked the documentat for six it looks like I was right - it represents unicode textual data in both python2 and python3. Pelican was originally written in Python2 I guess. Next step is to write a new key-value pair to the metadata dictionary for each article. This plugin adds functional to python by enabling categories and not just a category for each article. It seems clear that adding a categories key to the metadata dict is an obvious way to do this. The value for the categories key is a list where each item is an instance of the Category class. This class is instantiat using two arguments, name which is the string from the previous row, and which is currently not understood .. printing the contents of shows that its a dictionary of all the settings. Easily assumed and good to confirm. I\u2019ll dig into the Category class in a moment, but first lets quickly cover the last row of the function. The category attribute of the articles metadata is simply updated with the first item in the categories list (categorie must be a list because it can be indexed.) class Category() This class is the only class defined by the plugin (which is only 96 lines of code). It has 6 methods, 5 of them are decorated, and it has no constants. The decorators are property [3], _name.sett [1] and [1]. URLWrapper is imported from and I don\u2019t know what that does beyond \u201cwrapping URLs\u201d. @property Decorators are functions that takes methods or functions as inputs. Using property along with setter decorators lets a class have a property assigned to it whilst ensuring that arbitrary conditions or logic is upheld. If the @property decorator is over a method called foo, then there would need to be a decorator called foo.setter on a method somewhere in the class. That doesn\u2019t seem entirely right though, because in our Category class, we have a @property decorator over a _name method, and also a @_name.set decorator over another method called _name. But the other methods with @property decorators (slug and ancestors) do not have any associated setter decorators or methods. The setter for _name seems to create parent categories if the string contains slashes: @_name.set def _name(self val): if '/' in val: parentname val = 1) self.paren = self.setti else: self.paren = None self.short = val.strip( Here, self.paren becomes an instance of the category class, that is instantiat using parentname and self.setti This is recursive to however many levels of subcategor are specified. The ancestors and as_dict methods seem more confusing. ancestors isn\u2019t called or mentioned within the class definition but is called from the function which is called after the get_catego function returns. I don\u2019t understand why it needs an @property decorator though. The class inherits from URLWrapper so that is probably the next best place to look\u2026 Indeed, looking at the definition of URLWrapper shows that the as_dict method is overriding the definition in the base class.I guess it\u2019s the \u201ccurse of knowledge\u201d \u21a9"},{"title":"Different Views For Different\u00a0Users","url":"different-views-for-different-users.html","body":"This blog serves a variety of purposes.

I think I could group problems into 3 buckets, based on how much time they take to solve. Type 1 takes less than 15 minutes to solve, type 2 takes between 15 and 45 minutes to solve, and type 3 takes more than 45 minutes (usualy much more). Type 3: When I start learning a hard thing (like web developmen almost everything is in the third bucket and it\u2019s exhausting You need to set aside big chunks of time, you need to be focussed and undistract calm and wide awake, and you need to be prepared for a long arduous journey. Probably your criteria for success should be \u201cam I dead?\u201d because then if you\u2019re asking the question you\u2019re guaranteed to be successful and keeping morale high is necessary for success. Type 2: Hopefully you can make good progress understand the basics and internaliz the relevant abstractio and your problems quickly1 become type 2 problems. They each take from 15 to 45 minutes to solve. Maybe this is because you know enough to break some big general problem into smaller problems (you are developing domain expertise) and your intuitions for how to solve the problem are becoming better so your first or second attempts are likely to be correct, rather than your fifth or sixth. Knowing how to google a problem so that you get the answer you need is also a really important skill, which requires intuiting how an English speaking expert would ask the question. This isn\u2019t trivial but I don\u2019t hear people discussing this often. When most of my coding problems are type 2, it feels like I\u2019m learning most efficientl and when I\u2019m most productive Type 1: After a while, the problems that need to be solved become type 1 problems. They take less than 15 minutes to solve, because: All the big problems have been solved and now you\u2019ve only got smaller problems left, and Your intuitions are good and your expertise has increased and you know where to look for answers.3 Exceptiona problems: But there seems to be a consistent exception to this model.4 Let\u2019s be silly and call them type W problems. These are the problems that eat up far too many hours, and are tiring to solve, even when you are (in most other respects) an expert. For me, these tend to relate to blob storage solutions for web apps deployed into production I can think of several factors why this is so, and I\u2019ll describe the specifics before generalisi When a web app runs in production the data is not stored on the web server because the things that make a web-server cheap and efficient are not the things that make a database or a file storage bucket cheap and efficient. Therefore they are stored somewhere else and you need some plumbing to join everything together. There are some abstractio involved to make this work easily and securely. However when developing locally, you are doing everything on your laptop. You have a web-server relational database and file system all in the same place. This is a big, fundamenta architectu difference between your developmen environmen and your production environmen As a general rule, these are supposed to be as similar as possible. These difference make it much easier to make something that works locally but doesn\u2019t work in production and it\u2019s very hard to test if a thing will work in production without deploying it to your staging environmen which you are likely less familiar with than your local developmen setup. Deploying to staging and debugging on staging is slower and harder than doing the same thing locally. Logging (and filtering) will likely be more important. Solving exceptiona problems So how do you solve these problems quickly and efficientl What is it about this problem that makes it so hard? Let\u2019s examine what makes the problem difficult to solve: Iteration cycles are slow - I can\u2019t test locally, I have to deploy to staging and this takes time. The problem occurs in a \u2018high friction\u2019 environmen - its difficult to dig around and figure out what\u2019s really going on when its hidden below 3 different layers of abstractio on a remote machine that I have limited access to via a web browser. I want to be able to dig and investigat quickly and easily using the same tools I use for writing and testing code locally. I\u2019ve taken great efforts to set up my local developmen environmen so that I can do this, and its stressful to switch to a different and more limited set of tools. The problem is the result of several things interactin at once, and I can\u2019t just test things one at a time. These things are probably very similar to the abstractio Thinking clearly, learning, buidling, solving problems, all rely on being able to separate or untangle a seemingly complex situation into its component parts so that you can figure out what causes what. If you can\u2019t isolate individual concerns or components you have a black box that is keeping you ignorant. In web developmen customized logging is usually a good way to being isolating and exploring particular components Having said all that, I think the best way to solve a problem is to prevent it from occurring in the first place, but I\u2019m not good enough to figure out how to do that, yet.on which timescale? Life is long, does it really matter if it takes 1 week or 1 month to learn something meaningful Momentum, and having fun, is important though. \u21a9from a personal growth point of view.

I don\u2019t expect writing regularly to become a permanent habit - it doesn\u2019t need to be. But I do want to focus on it for a while so that I become significan better. It\u2019s a skill that has too many benefits to be ignored. I realised that the blogs I remembered most were focussed and unapologet about their priorities Most of them have a lot of text and do not focus on design. They make it easy to read text, and don\u2019t spend time or attention on header images or styling. Before I redesigned this blog I had default settings that asked me to supply an image for each post, and for a summary, and a suggested tweet. None of it was necessary, and whilst they all tried to make the blog better they ended up making it worse because they added complexity and distracted from the main thing. These features are still there if I want to use them, but they are not set up to be used by default anymore. They\u2019ve been moved to the background and if I forget they exist then that is OK - it just shows they weren\u2019t as important in practice as I thought they\u2019d be when I was Yak Shaving. You Ain\u2019t Gonna Need It, mate.wikip article, and some extenal validation \u21a9and also, that asking the right question is more important than finding the right answer. I guess asking the right question is always necessary, but finding the right answer is only sometimes sufficient Sometimes you can get the answer a bit wrong if you asked the right question, and still get enough benefits to avoid the problem. \u21a9"},{"title":"Python: Becoming A Better Python\u00a0Developer","url":"becoming-a-better-python-developer.html","body":"I\u2019ve been subscribed to Aaron Maxwell\u2019s \u201cPowerful Python\u201d newsletter for over a year and I really like it.

The post mentions the idea that \u201cRSS is about capturing the long tail of blogs that don\u2019t post frequently 1. This idea crystalise why I was so glad I\u2019d started using RSS feeds again. If readers use RSS, then authors don\u2019t need to concern themselves with attention. This removes pressure on the author to post frequently and lets them focus on quality over quantity. News feeds and ad supported platforms have fundamenta different mechanics and incentives With RSS I can let good quality content come to me, on its own schedule. I don\u2019t need to remember to look for it, and the authors don\u2019t need to remind me that they exist. Google Reader RSS is a very effective way of having good quality informatio come to you. Back in 2008, I used to use Google Reader to subscribe to RSS feeds. I was an aspiring photograph back then and I remember being subscribed to around 80 blogs. Each day I\u2019d read articles from whoever had posted something new, without needing to visit their websites or remember who they are or that I\u2019d subscribed to their blog. The authors didn\u2019t need to optimize their output according to an opaque and changing algorithm either - they didn\u2019t need to optimize article length, tags, post frequency, image inclusion or linked content. They could write how they wanted to, which I suspect leads to higher quality content. Social Media A few years later Google Reader was closed down, presumably because using RSS didn\u2019t fit with Googles advertisin model. I was unaware of it at the time but I imagine it sent shockwaves through blogging communitie and probably upended many businesses I mostly stopped reading blogs. Facebook was growing fast, Instagram felt new and exciting, and content was moving onto \u2018platforms or into walled gardens. And as they kept on growing the average quality of the content decreased. Twitter is like this now I think. There are some real diamonds to be found from time to time, but there\u2019s a lot of mud too. Mostly its just mud, but the occasional diamond can have outsized benefits. RSS isn\u2019t like this. I choose the contents of my \u2018news feed\u2019, and each article can be much longer than a Tweet, or a caption to a photo, or a status update. It\u2019s hard to write well and to create an interestin or useful blog post, and that makes it harder to dilute quality with entertaini distractio I have complete control about what content I see, and I can change it whenever I want. The process is designed around me. Reeder5 I used netNewsWir for a few weeks, but it couldn\u2019t sync between my laptop and phone, so I bought Reeder 5. It\u2019s got a few unusual design patterns, but it works well and has all the features I want. I\u2019ve been unsubscrib from email newsletter and subscribin to the RSS feed instead. It keeps my inbox quieter, and it feels good to have a \u2018separatio of concerns\u2019.

I was working as an accountant and Excel wasn\u2019t good enough anymore, so I looked around for a way to get started and came across Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks are said to be a kind of \u201cgateway drug\u201d to programmin and I think that\u2019s true. They\u2019re the easiest and fastest way to start programmin that I\u2019ve come\u00a0acros When you\u2019re working in a notebook, its easy to get data, wrangle it, and show some results.

But the end-goal, the ultimate solution, is a data driven web app, with saved user preference scalable performanc and automatica updated data\u00a0sourc A personal When I moved to the Netherland I wanted to use a personal finances dashboard to check weekly expenses. There wasn\u2019t a web-app that would do this (though there are a couple of apps that are trying) so I built my own dashboard. Then a few friends asked if they could use it too. They couldn\u2019t because it was just a dashboard and not a web app, but I thought this was a good reason to jump into It was a much bigger task than I anticipate (And that\u2019s OK.) It took several attempts and was super frustratin I would dabble for a few weeks, do a few tutorials, and then get completely lost when I tried to do something by myself. I\u2019d get disorienta working across many different files and trying to visualise which part of the model, or the cycle I was currently working\u00a0on I came to realisea that the mental load seems so large at the beginning because is really a whole stack of technologi and abstractio combined (or stacked) together. Many of these have to be used together at the same time before you can see any evidence of success at all. I think the hardest things about Django are not actually Django. You\u2019ll need to comfortabl with classes and inheritanc You\u2019ll also need to be comfortabl with working across multiple files, and have some tools for searching across all you open buffers, or all the files in the project, at the same time. You\u2019ll also need to be comfortabl with version control (Git) and using the command line. Get familiar with stack traces\u00a0too If you\u2019re familiar enough with all these things, so that using them doesn\u2019t feel new, but ideally feels familiar and comfortabl then I think you\u2019ll make quite quick progress with\u00a0Djang Django uses the model. Models are how django maps Python objects to items in your database (oh yeah, you need to be familiar with SQL too\u2026), Views are where requests are processed (also Middleware and turned into Responses, which are then combined with templates (unless your building an API). You might notice I haven\u2019t mentioned what a Controller is - get used to informatio feeling incomplete whilst you\u2019re learning the ropes. It\u2019ll become clear soon\u00a0enoug The best\u00a0momen The \u2018curse of knowledge\u2019 states that once you\u2019ve learnt something you can\u2019t imagine or remember what it\u2019s like to not know it. Before that happens completely I want to record some of the \u2018ahah!\u2019 moments of For context, I stopped working as a freelance data scientist in April and after a few weeks wondering if django and PostgreSQL and python was the way to go (yes it is. use boring technology I began working full-time on what would become MoneyBar.n I called it \u2018myeuros\u2019 in the\u00a0beginn The learning curve felt steep. I wanted to do things \u201cright\u201d the first time because I wasn\u2019t building a toy, and although I felt that hindsight would show this to be a mistake in terms of efficiency I did it anyway because I have a hunch that following my compulsion sometimes makes life harder in the short term and better in the long\u00a0term. The best moments are usually preceded by the Adding a unique identifier to an existing I used pydanny\u2019s template. Honestly, by the time I\u2019d gone through the quickstart process and googled the nouns in all the questions (what is Sentry, what is Celery and what is a task que, what is whitenoise etc.) I was already tired. Play with it a few times and come back to\u00a0it. Anyway, I wanted to start with because the project template has that part kind of up and rnuning for you out of the box. uses the Django Allauth package, which is awesome, and reliable, and fully featured\u2026 and extremely abstracted Good luck looking at the module code and understand it if youre not an\u00a0expert. I wanted to give each user a unique ID - a UUID when they signed up. This would be used in query strings instead of usernames or incrementa keys. This was so hard the first time! And it turns out its not a trivial task, not if you already have a few users in your (test) database. Sure you can reset the database and start again, but experiment like this is fairly complex. Understand how the python model classes (the ORM) maps to the relations in the PostgreSQL databse was complex, and if I got confused, should I try to fix it by changing python Models, or editing migrations or working on the database directly? Getting started is one of the After I\u2019d figured out I started creating models for other simpler data (transacti and bank accounts I expect). This was much simpler and faster. I remember driving home one evening thinking that if I could get this far then success Testing\u00a0co Before long, testing each part of the app by hand when I added or changed a feature was no longer trivial. I needed to find some way of automatica creating users and checking that they could log in and access\u00a0vie I began working with pytest, and really found it hard to wrap my head around the idea accessing different parts of the app not by requests and responses but by accessing class I think its normal and good to code at the limit of your knowledge, where you know just enough to make a thing \u201cwork\u201d. But this approach falters when you want to then test what you wrote. Or at least, the measure of \u201cjust enough\u201d really changes when you require tests to be written. You don\u2019t just need to make it work, you need to understand why it works, so that you can write tests to assert that certain conditions pass and others\u00a0fai This feels really satisfying when it works, because you have proof that you really have grasped a bigger picture. There are far fewer (relevant) black boxes when you write tests. But it also makes learning slower, at least in the short term. It means you might have two get comfortabl with a handful of abstractio when you\u2019ve already solved the problem you started with.

This requiremen encourages modular code base architectu with the code broken down into When working on a data science project you often have a well defined and quite narrow pipe line.

In web developmen there seems to be more boilerplat many more files spread across a tree of directorie and the average number of lines of code per file is IDE\u00a0featur These difference mean that code organizati tools and IDE features play very different roles within each industry. In web developmen you really need to be able to jump between different files (or buffers) quickly, and search for text across multiple files. Writing idiomatica becomes more important, and writing code within discreet testable units becomes essential so that things don\u2019t break without being\u00a0noti In data science, linting feels more optional, and searching for text within methods or functions outside the current module is\u00a0rarer.

Errr\u2026 Django was a big enough pile of abstractio as it was. Views, ORMs, mixins, serializer Trying to add factories and fixtures into that took some getting used to. But eventually I made some progress, and now I quite enjoy running coverage reports to keep coverage close to 100%1. Some of the main things I\u2019ve learnt about writing tests: Use PyTest as much as possible rather than other testing libraries - its assert statements are more intuitive than Django\u2019s own testing framework, and you can use it in any Python codebase, not just Django. It has lots of extensions and seems good at getting the job done fairly easily. Write tests as you go. I haven\u2019t (yet) reached the elevated level of writing tests before I write the code to be tested, though I see why that would sometimes be useful. I do think writing tests sooner rather than later is best though, ideally as soon as you\u2019ve got a basic version of your feature working. Use Coverage to show you which code is covered by your tests, and which branches or edge cases are not. But be warned, it doesn\u2019t tell you if the test is useful or not, only that it passes and which methods or functions it uses. Fixtures are great for keeping tests fairly DRY. Freezegun is great for testing anything to do with dates and times. Static type checkers, like Mypy, get more attractive in proportion to codebase complexity and size. Which is fun and all, but testing for the sake of it doesn\u2019t necessaril stop bad things happening. Its very possible to write a test that covers the code you\u2019ve just written without ensuring that only the intended behaviours happen. \u21a9"},{"title":"Why Start Talking About Faith In\u00a0Jesus?","url":"faith-in-jesus.html","body":"Start with happiness It seems to me that I am much happier as a Christian than I would be if I weren\u2019t. By \u201cbeing a Christian\u201d I mean following Jesus - trying my best to act, think and speak like he want\u2019s me to because I\u2019m grateful that he did what I believe he did. I believe he died for my sins and is now alive, having been miraculous resurrecte by his father1 (who is now my father too). It\u2019s not just an intellectu exercise. I believe that Jesus is alive because I seem to have experience his companions and interventi in my day-to-day life. This is unusual, mind boggling, and makes things significan more complicate than if I thought he were dead. Nonetheles it seems to be true. It\u2019s not like I see supernatur interventi every day or anything, but there have been various times - too many to discard - when my prayers have been answered in practical ways (I\u2019ll leave out the intangible for now) that have surprised me and given me a lot of respect for the risen Jesus doing what its said he\u2019d do in the bible. Obvious answers There was this time I was in Yemen trying to get back to my room across town, at night and during a storm. I was lost and couldn\u2019t read Arabic to understand which bus to get. So I prayed, and two buses later I got off at the right stop. Another example, I was getting a haircut in Liverpool Street Station in London, and as I was sitting in the chair someone took my work bag. When I came to pay, I realised my laptop and wallet had gone. Trying to find a stolen bag in central London feels ridiculous Even so, I spent a few hours wondering around the alleys and parks looking for it, and I resigned myself to some awkward conversati and using most of my next salary to replace the stolen computer. To my surprise, my parents-in prayed about it and were really confident it would come back to me, which seemed super unlikely. A few days later I received a call from an office worker in the Gherkin building - my bag was under his desk and he wanted to know if I\u2019d like to collect it. I guess I\u2019ll try not to make the same mistake twice. The other example I tend to remember happened not long after I\u2019d first moved to Vienna. I was feeling lonely and isolated and I was wondering how on earth I was going to find some sort of normal that was healthy and sustainabl Try as I might, I wasn\u2019t enjoying things at all and was feeling stressed and overwhelme I remember walking up this steep hill in the 18th district towards my office, and repeatedly praying this really simple prayer \u2018God, please help, please help, please help..\u2019. It was that simple because I couldn\u2019t think of anything more useful to say. Nothing dramatic happened that day, or even that week as far as I can remember. But when I look back, it was a turning point when things started getting better instead of worse. I suppose you can call this last example an intangible answer to prayer. Maybe it is, but I think anyone whose grappled with overwhelmi loneliness or panic would say that the emotions become all too tangible at times. Being in a different emotional state seemed to make a tangible difference to just about every area of life. Eating, productivi at work, relationsh with friends and colleagues etc. This is only the beginning of why I think Jesus is alive and why I think Christiani is a real and living faith. It\u2019s not primarily a tradition, a worldview or a set of rules and ideals. Christiani is a relationsh with Jesus. He did lots of amazing things that have let me have a very practical relationsh with him. It\u2019s an almost unbelievab premise from which to live a life. It has so many implicatio And it holds up to scrutiny and my experience bear it out. Why write this? Despite Jesus\u2019 incredible works and their implicatio modern Christiani seems to be in a really confused and ineffectiv state. Ideas and thoughts about have become mixed up with cultural christiani or christian politics and traditions These are each different things, and unless we distinguis between them with the words we use, we are going to find it hard to think and communicat clearly. I suspect that we are in a negative cycle of imprecise thinking leading to imprecise articulati which leads to further imprecise thinking. Unless we can talk and think about one thing at a time, atomically if necessary, we take on the additional risks of reaching the wrong conclusion personally or arguing with others due to rather than actual disagreeme We should try to create a more precise vocabulary to navigate our Christian lives, so that we can think clearly about the experience and questions we have. Imprecise thinking is frustratin and conversati are less effective when there\u2019s an increased risk of disagreeme or what someone else means. This makes it harder to talk about our faith, which makes talking less common, and this creates room for or apathy, or missed opportunit or sadness.An many other things also. \u21a9from first principals \u21a9"},{"title":"API Design\u00a0Principles","url":"api-design.html","body":"Some super brief notes I made about API\u00a0design Background It\u2019s more of an art than a\u00a0science RESTful State Transfer) API design is an Alternativ API architectu SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a heavier\u00a0st GraphQL - doesnt overfetch.

You might think that\u2019s a unusual way to prepare for an interview, and you\u2019d be right. Nothing close to these notes arose during the interview, but I find this stuff interestin If I\u2019m motivated enough to study it, then I think that\u2019s a good enough reason by itself, without a specific reason. These are some brief notes. Object Orientated Programmin has four key aspects: Encapsulat (Hiding informatio Abstractio (Hiding the Inheritanc Polymorphi 1. Encapsulat Each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Instance are kept private and accessor methods are made public. Other objects don\u2019t have direct access to this state. They can only call a list of public functions (methods). The object manages its own state via methods, no other class can touch it unless explicitly (not default) allowed. Private variables. Public methods. You can define classes within classes, and functions within functions. 2. Abstractio A natural extension of encapsulat A concept or idea that is not associated with any particular instance. Expresses the intent of the class, rather than a specific Programs are often extremely large and separate objects communicat with each other a lot. This makes maintainin large programs difficult, and abstractio tries to solve this. Applying abstractio means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it. This mechanism should hide internal implementa details. It should only reveal operations relevant for the other objects. This mechanism should be easy to use and should rarely change over time. Implementa changes \u2014 for example, a software update \u2014 rarely affect the abstractio you use. e.g. a coffee machine. It does a lot of stuff and makes quirky noises under the hood. But all you have to do is put in coffee and press a button. 3. Inheritanc In OOP, objects are often similar, sharing similar logic. But they are not 100% the same. Create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy. child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own unique part using method or attribute overloadin 4. Polymorphi Gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there\u2019s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are. This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods. Any time a collection (such as a list) or a method expects an instance of the parent (where common methods are outlined), the language takes care of evaluating the right implementa of the common method \u2014 regardless of which child is passed. I\u2019d like to be so familiar with the following features that I can use them without referring to notes: Getters and setters. Instance methods compared to class methods. Inheritanc mixins, and decorators The \u201cmagic\u201d within the Django source code that requires mypy to use extensions in order to do its static type checking correctly.

Functional value metrics are \u201cper user\u201d or \u201cper 100 videos\u201d. Pricing scales around functions of usage. Outcome based value metrics charge based on the outcome, e.g. how many views a video received, or how much money a customer made when using your payment Many SaaS companies rely on feature as a way to justify higher prices, but this produces higher\u00a0chu Value metrics outperform feature with upto 75% less\u00a0churn Outcome based value metrics reduce church by an additional A good value metric is easy for a customer to understand They need to immediatel understand what they\u2019re paying for and where they fit in your structure.

General advice for hard things including asking hard questions - imagine you were delegating the task, what would you tel the person to do?

Opinions don\u2019t\u00a0coun A lukewarm response to your idea can be a great conversati because you realise that your idea isn\u2019t a great idea. Lukewarm means they don\u2019t care enough to buy the first (worst) version before it\u2019s\u00a0ready Look before you zoom.

Leveling up requires one more abstractio to wrap my head around, or one more API to understand I can do\u00a0it. But I don\u2019t think it needed to be so difficult, so now I\u2019m building Code School Meta to make it easier to learn how to\u00a0code. Learning to code has been fun, ultimately successful and life changing (hello job security!) but at the beginning it was sooo slow, and super\u00a0tric I remember feeling like an imposter, and thinking that I was definitely not a real developer - I hadn\u2019t taken any classes in computer science. I felt like I knew almost nothing The process began with Pandas, a (the) Python analytics library. Spreadshee were slowing me down at work, and I was bored. I found this great tutorial by Brandon Rhodes. From there I found out about Jupyter Notebooks, and then I found about Github pages and how to make a blog using pelican. That led to HTML and CSS (and also JavaScript which I tried very hard to avoid for as long as possible). I felt like a monkey bashing a keyboard as I tried to make HTML elements do what I\u00a0wanted. Git was next, but I found this amazing tutorial to help me learn. It made Git seem OK, and also helped HTML and CSS make more sense too.\u00a0Bonus I suddenly realized that great learning materials are crucial if I was going to keep momentum and keep on enjoying the thrill of seeing the computer do something I hadn\u2019t made it do\u00a0before.

For example, \u201cWhat will the Euro-Dolla exchange rate be on date\u00a0X?\u201d. In several common forecastin scenarios, prediction markets have been more accurate than polls, expert opinions, and statistica methods1 and therefore prediction models are useful for observers (anybody who is interested in the outcome) and not just the market\u2019s participan Prediction markets can be used for categorica events (a specific event that either does or doesn\u2019t happen) or scalar events (when the outcome is between a range of values). The predefined source of truth for the outcomes being predicted is called an\u00a0Oracle. Prediction markets enables participan to purchase shares or tokens tied to the outcome of a specific future event. Once the event has occurred, holders of the tokens representi the actual outcome will receive a reward of predefined value. This creates an incentive to hold tokens correspond to the correct outcome, and the market dynamics of supply and demand allow the price to reflect perceived probabilit of different outcomes. Helpfully, the price of each type of token correspond to the relative probabilit of each outcome occurring which allows for simple interpreta of the results. If the reward for holding a share correspond to the correct outcome is $1, and the present price of this share is 50 cents, then the market\u2019s estimate of the likelihood of this outcome occurring is\u00a050%. Shares can be traded continuous As trading occurs over time the probabilit of different outcomes will change as new informatio becomes known, and the changing price of the shares quantify\u00a0t An\u00a0example Let\u2019s describe how this could work with an\u00a0example There is a large degree of uncertaint around how Britain will continue to trade with the other European countries when it exits the EU on March 29, 2019. A prediction market will likely be a better predictor of the outcome than any other\u00a0meth If an adequate agreement isn\u2019t achieved, Britain\u2019s main port at Dover will certainly experience long delays and large traffic jams. Therefore a prediction market asking \u201cHow many vehicles will be admitted into Britain at the port of Dover between 00:00 and 23:59 on March 29 2019?\u201d will give a useful prediction about the outcome of Britain\u2019s trade negotiatio - a key component and sticking point in the Each type of token in the prediction market will correspond to different quantities of vehicles entering the port3 - for example there could be four (or more) categories Less than 8000, between 8000 and 11000, between 11000 and 14000, and more than 14000. The relative price of a share in each category will correspond to the relative probabilit of each If the number of vehicles is lower than would otherwise be expected, (around 12000) this would likely be due to the impact of Brexit and thus the market will serve as a useful proxy for predicting what kind of Brexit will\u00a0occur Stakeholde incentives are\u00a0aligne One reason that prediction markets work so well is because they aggregate informatio from disparate sources and the price shows not only an impartial assessment of the most likely outcome but the aggregated level of confidence that the participan have. Since no one is obliged to participat those that do believe they have valuable informatio which gives them a competitiv advantage. This creates a mechanism that moves good quality informatio into the prediction market, with the resulting prices reflecting the probabilit of a range of\u00a0outcome In our example, people with relevant informatio would include port employees, business owners in the UK and in Europe, politician civil servants, business analysts, bankers, etc. Whilst it is clear that any of these roles may have useful informatio or judgement about the outcome, it is not clear how useful each participan role is relative to the others. By allowing a participan to bid for as many shares in as many different categories as they want, each participan confidence in their informatio can be\u00a0quantif In this way, prediction markets align the incentives of market participan and observers. If the market is large enough then it becomes prohibitiv expensive to distort the market and promote poor quality informatio including informatio designed to create FUD (Fear, Uncertaint Doubt), fake news, or Prediction markets are nothing new, with political betting being used to make prediction as early as the 1500s. However the adoption of the internet and decentrali networks now allow prediction markets to be used more widely and cheaply than ever before. Gnosis is building a platform on the Ethereum blockchain on which others can build new applicatio which harness the power of By lowering the cost and complexity of creating a prediction market, observers can benefit from high quality and impartial predictive informatio about future events, and market participan are rewarded for accurate assessment of likely outcomes. This will enable better decision making and empower observers with previously unobtainab insight.

Hours range from 9am - 7pm Monday - Friday, to\u00a024/7. First place: Dogpatch\u00a0L Dogpatch offer a coworking space and access to a community of tech startups. They run regular networking and mentoring events and occupy 3 floors of a warehouse next to an old dock. The offices have a range of interiors styles. The middle level is fairly standard but pleasant open plan offices, the top floor is a flexible working space with event areas. The lower level is a series of vaults that each contain meeting rooms of various sizes. There\u2019s a lot going on and there\u2019s a good buzz in the\u00a0air. The range of interior spaces is a big plus for me and I\u2019m looking forward to being able to switch up my working environmen through the day. There\u2019s a couple of kitchen areas, and a table football and table-tenn table on the top level. Access is 6am - midnight, and a hot desk is \u20ac200 per month. A dedicated desk is\u00a0\u20ac400. Dogpatch occupy less than a quarter of the warehouse building, the remainder of the space is used as a shopping mall and a museum. In my opinion Dogpatch is by far the best value and if you\u2019re working in tech it\u2019ll probably be your Second place: Studio9 These guys are great. The space is a lot smaller that Dogpatch, comprising only ~12 desks. It\u2019s a basement, but don\u2019t let that put you off \u2014 its open plan and has large windows at either end. The space is well designed and uses a lot of light colours and textures, including wood on the walls and floors. There are also plenty of pot plants. These combine to give a bright and airy atmosphere that feels very natural and\u00a0bright There are alcoves down one side of the main room which serve as meeting rooms, and a garden and basic kitchen at the back. The owners want the space to foster a community, and I expect that this is achieved. There are no dedicated offices and no teams using multiple desks, everyone is an The desks are large, and each has its own little wall to provide some privacy. \u20ac200 per month ongoing, or \u20ac250 for just one month. They offer a trial day for\u00a0free. Third place: OfficeSuit The building looks well run and appears clean and fresh with adequate resources. The building is an old Georgian tenement with high ceilings, cornicing and lots of natural light. The furnishing and decor lean towards corporate rather than something more interestin but this works well to add a profession feel to the homely architectu Access is\u00a024/7. There\u2019s only two rooms for hotdesking and most of the building is given to private offices. There\u2019s a garden with bike storage, meeting rooms and a quiet room for calls. Lockers are extra. They also offer a free day as a\u00a0trial. \u20ac249 p/m for desk access 9am-7pm Monday -\u00a0Friday Fourth place: Element78 Friendly and well resourced, but very corporate. The architectu is corporate glass and steel. They\u2019re situated on the ground floor in a posh business district with large financials for neighbours It\u2019s too corporate for me, but if you wanted an impressive place to meet clients and a nice address, this could be it. There were about 15 hot-desks for rent, plus plenty of dedicated desks. Clients seemed to include mostly young tech companies and I\u2019m hoping to find somewhere with more of a community, more inspiring architectu and more character. I was offered a free day as a\u00a0trial. \u20ac200 for the first month then \u20ac350\u00a0p/m Fifth place: Glandore Glandore offer a relatively luxurious package with a corporate feel. They have a few buildings in Dublin and only the flagship has hotdesking space. There\u2019s a super looking restaurant and a large club room to relax in, but these are features that I don\u2019t need, and the rates aren\u2019t competitiv if all you need is a desk and somewhere to take calls. It\u2019s set up for teams and for impressing clients, and independen tech workers are probably better off\u00a0elsewh \u20ac295\u00a0p/m Sixth place: Regus Regus offer a polished on boarding experience and the friendly staff were quick to respond and generally helpful, but the office space was bland, grey and generic. The rooms I visited didn\u2019t have external windows and it reminded me of the rooms banks often put auditors in. If grey walls and tube lights are your thing then this is for you. 24/7 access, and meeting rooms equipped with\u00a0A/V. \u20ac299.70\u00a0p/ Seventh place: CoCreate I visited the southern branch and thought the building was a bit shabby and needed a new layer of paint. I recognised the desks as some of the cheapest available from IKEA. The rooms were small and needed cleaning, and there was weird art on the\u00a0wall. The thought of paying \u20ac200 a month to sit at a small wobbly desk put me off. The place was also almost deserted. Maybe their other branch is better, but this is not for\u00a0me. \u20ac220\u00a0p/m. Last place: tCube Last and least, tCube seems to be putting in zero effort. When I visited I saw two rooms that needed painting, disorganis furniture and abandoned bits of computers lying around. The kitchen isn\u2019t high spec and the meeting room isn\u2019t big enough.

My stay in London has been defined by my quest to complete my graduate scheme and qualify as an\u00a0account When I first arrived I had no idea what London or working in a corporate would be like.

The only thing you really own is your knowledge and your network In 2014, I arrived with a high opinion of my employer and the view that I would be staying for several years. Having escaped the financial insecurity of short-term research grants, I\u2019d moved back to my home country to contribute to the system that educated me. I was happy to have a regular job with a decent, A phrase that kept coming to mind back then was \u201caccountan factory\u201d. Our training materials were scripted and everything was a standardis process. We were being processed. Graduates in, corporate The company is huge and so are the efficienci and barriers to competitio that come with this.

Now I ignore any communicat addressed to a mailing\u00a0li Accountant The toughest experience were related to the accountanc qualificat Na\u00efvely I had believed that the qualificat wouldn\u2019t be a big deal and I didn\u2019t give any thought to it when I applied \u2014 I just wanted to find out how banks worked. If there were some exams to be done then it would be fine, I\u2019d already achieved a PhD and I would handle\u00a0it. That turned out to be a mistake. A huge mistake. The alarm bells should have rung louder when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so that they could get the qualificat (and were already intending to leave asap afterwards Doing the pre-course work before college wasn\u2019t trivial. College - I was being sent to a classroom again. We were being taken out of the office, away from clients, and put in a classroom to prepare for these\u00a0exam Starting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant without considerin the effort and time involved to qualify was dumb. It\u2019s an oversight I find hard to\u00a0believe The disappoint and sadness at having to study again was profound. The teaching and assessment style was several steps behind what I\u2019d become used to. Compared to the depth, autonomy and research-f of a doctorate, writing cookie-cut essays in time-press exams felt stupid. The exams were hard and I failed several of them, probably because of my low morale whilst revising. Retaking them required more weekends and annual leave being spent away from my family, camped-out in libraries and\u00a0office This required much patience and generosity from Ritsya, who having not seen me for long periods during my doctorate expected us to have a more normal lifestyle when we came to London. I found it miserable to pause my social life and other interests whilst studying, and then I would try to rush back to them when I had the time, knowing that soon I\u2019d have to pause them\u00a0again If I hadn\u2019t already studied in Vienna, this process of working and studying in London would have been exciting and felt valuable or special. I\u2019d passed enough exams though to know that they\u2019re never as important as they\u2019re made out to be, and whatever it was that was missing from my life wasn\u2019t going to be found in On the upside though, the ACA is the most practical qualificat I\u2019ve gained and has taught me many useful aspects of business and finance. I\u2019m glad to finally see business not as some mysterious system but something attainable Neighbourh Living in London has also required a lot of time on trains \u2014 my door to desk commute is about an hour each way, and I\u2019ve never lived somewhere in London that hasn\u2019t felt transient.

We\u2019re all looking to move on and move up as fast as possible. I want to leave London partly because there are so many people with the same attitudes and priorities as my\u00a0own\u2026 Back in the office I spent the first few months figuring out how people were organised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. I think it took me about a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years to feel like I could do all aspects of my job with certainty. There is a difference between how things are spoken about, and how things My experience has been that performanc is all that matters and behaviour is defined by self-inter I don\u2019t think this is different from previous environmen I\u2019ve worked in \u2014 academia isn\u2019t any different1 and the constructi industry certainly isn\u2019t.

I find myself wishing we could be kinder to each other, and that we could create structures that incentivis Corporate finance usually appears clean and well presented. Its people appear dependable and capable. The culture is sanitised and there\u2019s a lot of pressure to conform - you can see it in the clothes and accessorie we wear and the jokes we tell each other in the\u00a0cantee I came to see my office as a glass and steel cathedral. I read about the Middle East, and migrants arriving in Europe, and tower blocks burning, and felt Despite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we don\u2019t ask each other how we can help. Maybe we are too busy, or feel powerless to help. Apparently we do not know how to help, despite our wealth, talents, education I remember watching a man leave the office one day and thought that if he gave his whole career and left his firm after decades of service, there would be nothing left to identify him after a few weeks. The work will always get done. Market forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. The City rolls\u00a0on.

These transactio were authentica using PKI\u00a0which: Ensured Prevented participan claiming that they didn\u2019t make a Prevents anyone creating a transactio on someone else\u2019s behalf without their\u00a0cons As the number of people in the network grows, the transfer of coins from one user to another becomes harder to track. If every users ledger is not identical then the opportunit arises to use coins that have already been spent to pay someone who doesn\u2019t know they\u2019ve already been\u00a0used. This is double spending, and is possible because the ledger that is shared amongst all members of the group only has weak consistenc - it is not necessaril correct all the time in all\u00a0locati Weak consistenc could be solved by requiring that everyone votes to accept a transactio before it is accepted into the ledger (Unanimous consensus) or to save time we could reduce the requiremen so that only 50% of all users validate a transactio before it is accepted into the ledger (Quorum consensus) Either of these solutions is possible for a small local group with a list of all\u00a0users. However Unanimous or Quorum Consensus doesn\u2019t solve the weak consistenc problem\u00a0if The group is\u00a0large The group is small but spread across different locations or\u00a0timezon It is not possible to know how many members there are and therefore what proportion of users The real identity of a user is\u00a0unknown In these cases a peer-to-pe network is required where transactio between users require approval by other users before being confirmed. This has not been trivial to solve, as some users would be incentivis to be dishonest, and some may make mistakes. This is the distribute consensus problem, which on wikipedia is defined\u00a0as The consensus problem requires agreement among a number of agents for a single data value. Some of the processes (agents) may fail or be unreliable in other ways, so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow put forth their candidate values, communicat with one another, and agree on a single When the number and identity of participan is known, distribute consensus is possible. Two types of protocol which allows all users in a distribute system to agree on a transactio are the Paxos family of protocols and the Two-phase commit protocol. Both of these would require that at least 50% of all users reach agreement in order to add a However in a public peer-to-pe network the total number of active users is not known - its fast and cheap to create new user profiles, and existing user profiles may become dormant. This makes it impossible to know how many users 50% would be. Additional because its possible to cheaply create new user profiles (just generate a new public-pri key pair), a single actor could generate and control many user accounts in order to have many votes and force incorrect transactio onto the ledger. An attack where one user subverts a network by creating many profiles is known as a Sybil attack. Proof of\u00a0Work The solution to the Sybil attack is to increase the cost of verifying a transactio such that the cost exceeds the reward. This is achieved through proof-of-w (PoW) algorithms which are expensive for a sender claiming to have verified a transactio and simple for the receiver to verify that the sender has validated One possible Proof of Work approach is to require that the hash of a verificati message begins with a certain set of characters The chosen set of characters is called a nonce and the only way to create a verificati message with an acceptable hash is to try many slightly different messages. For example, a nonce may be 3 zeros. It\u2019s arbitrary, but the longer the nonce is the more difficult it becomes to find a hash that fits This is because a hash is a random list of characters and altering even a single part of the data being hashed will result in a completely different hash value. Therefore there is no way to predict a hash value. The only way to generate a hash with the required none is to repeatedly alter the data being hashed (even by just one character) until a hash with the required features is randomly achieved. This is expensive to achieve, but simple to\u00a0verify. Using the method, a user who seeks to verify a transactio and broadcast the result must (once they\u2019ve verified the transactio repeatedly try different messages until they randomly find a message that meets the nonce requiremen It is simple for a user to check if a transactio verificati message meets the nonce requiremen because it is simple to inspect a hash and compare it to the\u00a0nonce. The effect of this requiremen is a process that makes it expensive to claim that a transactio has been verified and cheap to check that verificati claim. This removes the threat of a Sybil attack, but does not remove the distribute consensus problems created by not\u00a0knowin The true identity of users in the\u00a0networ How many users\u00a0exis This problem cannot be completely solved, and the practical solution is to relax the requiremen such that the probabilit of accepting a fraudulent transactio is lower than some user defined threshold. This is acceptable because a user would require a higher degree of confirmati for a high-value transactio than they would for a low-value transactio and would therefore be willing to incur more time and cost to verify a high value transactio and reduce the probabilit of accepting an incorrect transactio below a\u00a0threshol If a user wishes to make fast or low-value transactio or trusts the party they\u2019re transactin with, then they may accept a transactio without any other users on the network verifying that the sender has the required However when the senders is not assured, verificati is required. The more risky or valuable the transactio the more users the receiver of the funds will ask to verify that the sender has access to the required funds. The higher the number of users, the higher the probabilit that a dishonest transactio will be identified before An appropriat level of verificati will depend on the amount being transferre and how well the receiver of the funds knows the\u00a0sender Asking peers on the network to verify transactio introduces a new problem. Verifying a transactio requires time and effort, and incurs a cost. This cost requires that network participan be rewarded for correctly verifying transactio between An attacker would only attack if the cost is less than the reward. Therefore the number and cost of verificati required should be just enough to make the cost of an attack more than the value of This introduces the problem that it costs more to verify a transactio than the value of the transactio itself. It is also create the recursive problem where the users who verified the first transactio would need to verify that the payment they received was then also valid. Furthermor a high proportion of the original transactio value is spent as a transactio fee (for verificati which is not\u00a0effici These problems are avoided by combining multiple transactio and verifying them at the same time, broadcasti the successful verificati of multiple transactio simultaneo by grouping the transactio together into a block By confirming multiple transactio at once (and proving it using transactio fees can be aggregated (allowing each individual fee to be much lower). Each block includes a list of verified transactio a reference to the previous block, and a block ID. Incentivis The transactio verificati process outlined above is remarkable because it creates a demand for new participan to the network by creating a financial incentive to verify transactio This makes the network more secure as increasing the number of participan makes a sybil attack Summary Users generate new transactio and broadcast them on a peer-to-pe network An idle user listens for new transactio and collects them until the sum of all transactio verificati fees is greater than the cost the user will incur to verify them and meet the The idle user adds an extra transactio to their list of transactio that transfers the sum of the transactio fees to their own\u00a0addres The idle user generates the block of newly verified transactio referencin the previously verified block so that transactio can be ordered and completing the proof-of-w challenge. This new block is then broadcast to the\u00a0networ Other users are listening for new block announceme These users verify that the block is valid according to the proof-of-w requiremen and the order of the\u00a0blocks Users with unverified transactio look inside the verified block to see if their pending transactio have been\u00a0accep Competing to validate blocks Each user can choose which transactio they verify, and how many to verify before beginning the proof-of-w requiremen and hopefully collecting the transactio fees. This lack of order around transactio verificati is fine because the only way to increase the probabilit of being the first to claim the transactio fees associated with a collection of transactio (a block) is to spend more CPU power searching for the required partial If two users complete a block at approximat the same time then the blockchain will look different in different parts of the network, as each completed block begins to propagate and other users accept the new block and add it to their ledger. This is ok if a rule is enforced that requires a user to always accept the longest chain of\u00a0blocks. This works because if multiple blocks are created at the same time, the time it takes to create subsequent blocks will vary due to the random behaviour of the proof-of-w algorithm. Therefore chains of different length will always exist and one version of the block chain will be longer than the others, providing a clear candidate for which branch of the blockchain to use. If there are transactio in the discarded branch which are not present in the new (longest) blockchain then they are added back into the pool of transactio A block of transactio in never The above procedure for verifying transactio and adding new blocks onto the chain means that even if a user inspects a new block and sees that their transactio has been verified, its possible that in the future a longer chain will be discovered (which must be accepted) which doesn\u2019t include Therefore any block could potentiall be removed, which means a transactio is never completely verified. However the probabilit of a block being removed decreases as the number of blocks after it increases. This means verificati can be thought of in terms of the number of blocks that have been added to the chain after the block containing If you are willing to accept a high level of risk, or you trust the party you are transactin with you could opt for a small number of blocks to be added after the block containing your transactio This has the benefit of increasing the speed of the transactio verificati If the transactio is risky or high-value you might require a larger number of blocks to be added to the chain before accepting the transactio This will increase the time required to verify the transactio but reduce the probabilit that a longer chain will undo the block containing the transactio in\u00a0questio"},{"title":"Move","url":"move.html","body":"Ambition Since I was 15, one of my ambitions has been to be an entreprene I used to joke with my dad about buying him a nice boat one\u00a0day.

For example a footer full of links that would never be used, and a sidebar full I opted for a single column design that hopefully presents text-heavy articles clearly and intuitivel (please leave a comment and tell me what you\u00a0think) Plugins My use of plugins to extend Pelican\u2019s functional reflects this, there is the Neighbors plugin so that the next or previous post can be accessed from the bottom of a post without going back to the index, and the Tag Cloud plugin to reflect which subjects are written about the most (and provide a link to all Speed The speed of the site is important because a faster site is more enjoyable to use.

I\u2019ve also set the CSS and JavaScript to load Images are optimised using the Optimize Images plugin so that their file size is as small as possible and they download quickly. The site uses CloudFlare free CDN features so hopefully no matter when you view the site from you get a decent page\u00a0speed I\u2019ve also arranged the homepage so that posts are shown by their category and then by posting date. This may not work very well with a larger number of posts, but I\u2019ll only consider that problem once it presents itself. Designing for hypothetic or conditions that don\u2019t yet exist is a waste of\u00a0time. There are examples of how I\u2019ve used Jinja templates below in the context of sharing my articles on Twitter and\u00a0Facebo Plugin: Share\u00a0Post I noticed that my posts were beginning to get tweeted about, so I thought it would be useful to have some sharing buttons at the bottom of each post for Twitter, Facebook and Email. Looking at the Pelican Plugins repo on Github showed there was (as usual) a plugin for this (called Share Post), though I noted it hadn\u2019t been updated for a couple of\u00a0years. Installing and initial set-up was simple thanks to the readme on the git repo. You need to copy the plugin folder to the plugins directory, and add the name of the plugin to the list in Then you need to copy paste some Jinja/HTML into the article.ht template. That\u2019s enough to make it\u00a0work. I noted though that when I shared to Twitter the text to be tweeted was encapsulat in quotes and there was a \u2018b\u2019 at the front. I realised this was due to using Python 3.x when the plugin (which hadn\u2019t been updated for 2 years) was likely written for Python 2.x. A quick google and the obligatory trip to SO showed me how to convert a bytes string to a normal text\u00a0strin # Python 2 tweet = ('%s%s' % (title, # Python 3 tweet_as_b = ('%s%s' % (title, tweet = I also found that an article couldn\u2019t be shared to twitter from a mobile device and this was due to the URL being incorrectl formatted. The new URL format required separate arguments for the URL, additional text and the # Incorrect twitter_li = % tweet # Correnct twitter_li = % (url, tweet, t_handle) Using meta-data to specify tweet\u00a0text I thought it would be cool to add some default text to a tweet, as I\u2019ve enjoyed this feature on other blogs when I\u2019ve found a post I wanted to share on Twitter. - A user may know they want to share an article but if they\u2019re in a hurry it might be hard to find the right words, so why not provide a ready-made tweet. The text is editable so it\u2019s only a\u00a0suggesti The text would be different for each post so it makes sense to specify it when writing the article. The article \u2018summary\u2019 would be too long, and I know that Pelican supports arbitrary meta-data tags. I assumed that Jinja would pick up the data the same way it picks up the \u2018standard\u2019 meta-data and added a function def tweet = '' if 'tweet'): tweet = return quote(('%s % else: return ' ' Once this function was working it was simply a case of calling the function and assigning the output to a variable I called \u201cTweet\u201d, and then adding \u201cTweet\u201d to the text string to be included in a tweets\u00a0tex tweet = tweet_as_b = ('%s' % tweet = t_handle = There was a bit of fiddling around to make sure that the number of spaces between each part of the tweet was correct, but nothing as complicate as when making Time Until. Specifying the text and image in a Facebook\u00a0s Sharing to Facebook worked without any formatting problems, but it bugged me that the opening text of the article was being used in the preview that was shared to Facebook when I had a summary already prepared and that would be much more useful to potential readers. For some articles I also had an article image that I wanted to see being\u00a0used Googling revealed that I needed to use particular meta tags in the webpage\u2019s header if I wanted to control what Facebook would pickup. Facebook uses the \u201copen graph\u201d standards so I would need the headers in my article pages to include the\u00a0follow `<!-- Open Graph data -->` `<meta content=\"T Here\" />` `<meta />` `<meta />` `<meta />` `<meta Here\" /> I could see that I already had some meta tags being generated using the Jinja templates so I set about copy-pasti and modifying them to build the new tags. I had some issues with trailing white space or line breaks being included within the content string. This was solved like\u00a0so: {# Adding '-' after and before the %'s strips white space and line breaks #} {% block descriptio %} {%- if -%} {{ }} {%- else -%} {{ }} {%- endif -%} {% endblock descriptio %} I also needed to use some blocks more than once, because a descriptio tag was already included but Facebook wants an and Twitter wants a too. All three of these tags will include the same text (generated in the Jinja2 snippet above). If a block only needs to be used once then it\u2019s generated like\u00a0this; <meta content=\"{ block descriptio %}{% endblock descriptio %}\"> But If you call \u201c{% block descriptio %}{% endblock descriptio %}\u201d again Jinja will throw you an error. The documentat (and SO) reveal that the solution is to\u00a0use: <meta content=\"{ }}\"> This allows you to reuse blocks multiple times and keep your Finally, when I was testing Facebook to see if the correct text or image was being picked up I was initially frustrated to see that the new tags were not having any effect. This is because Facebook crawls your site and saves what it finds. If you want it to take a fresh look at your page with its new meta tags, you need to tell Facebook to crawl the page again, using the Facebook You can see the new sharing buttons below, please click them and see what\u00a0happe Note: My first article describing how I began to use Pelican is here"},{"title":"Blockchains from the ground up: Part\u00a01","url":"blockchain-introduction.html","body":"How to maintain a reliable list across a small network without a This is part 1 of an introducti to the key features of a generalise blockchain I haven\u2019t included references to Bitcoin or any particular digital currencies or blockchain This is because a digital currency is just one applicatio of Create a financial document that cannot be forged or\u00a0dispute Let\u2019s imagine there is a village somewhere where people still trade by bartering. John has some apples whilst Lizzie has some oranges. John would like an orange, and offers Lizzie an apple in exchange. She accepts, and writes John a\u00a0receipt. Date: 1234 From: Lizzie To: John What: 1 Orange Price: 1 Apple So far, so good. The receipt is evidence of the transactio The next day John wants an orange but doesn\u2019t have anything to exchange. He offers to write Lizzie a note saying he owes Lizzie 1 orange (an IOU). They think about this and agree that John should sign the note so that Lizzie can prove that John owes her 1\u00a0orange. Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange Signed: John's signature, Lizzie's signature This IOU is a nice gesture, but it\u2019s simple to forge. Lizzie has the only copy of the IOU and once Lizzie has seen Johns signature, she could easily copy it and create more IOU\u2019s. She could also change this IOU from 1 orange to 11 oranges (for example) and John couldn\u2019t prove what the original amount was. If Lizzie and John disagreed over what was owed it would be impossible to know who was telling the truth. It\u2019s one person\u2019s word against the\u00a0other. Lizzie realises this and suggests an improvemen - they will find a witness and make 3 copies of the IOU. Each copy will be signed by Lizzie, John and the Witness. Lets call this Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange Witness: Walter Signed: \"John's signature\" \"Lizzie's signature\" \"Walter's signature\" This is a much stronger document and is more difficult to forge. If Lizzie changes the \u201cWhat:\u201d to \u201c11 Oranges\u201d, both John and Walter will have copies of the original with her signature on it. It will be 2 pieces of evidence against Lizzie\u2019s 1. Lizzie will be laughed out of court.\u00a0Hah 3 Party transactio work pretty well, and this is how most transactio are recorded today. But there is a weakness: If Lizzie can bribe Walter then the transactio can be falsified! John would rely on Walter to verify his version of the transactio but would be let down by Walters lack of integrity. Lizzie and Walter could change 1 orange to 11 oranges and if Lizzie offered Walter some of the extra oranges this would give them both an incentive to forge the documentat If Walter liked oranges enough, he might not care that his career as a witness will be\u00a0ruined. This is a problem for modern financial systems and a great deal of time, money and regulation is devoted to trying to ensure that third parties are trustworth E.G. If I buy a car and my bank is in cahoots with the car dealership I could be defrauded. Reducing this risk to an acceptably low level makes financial services slower and more expensive than they would otherwise need to\u00a0be. The solution is public-key infrastruc (which is introduced in my previous post). In this system, each individual generates their own public-pri key pair. They keep their private key private and make their public key freely available. A detailed descriptio of public-key cryptograp is out of scope for this post, but\u00a0briefl A public key is derived from a private key, and this pair together have a set of unique mathematic properties Either key can be used to encrypt a message but only the other key can be used to decrypt it. You cannot use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. If the private key is used to encrypt then anybody can decrypt (because the public key is publicly available) and whilst this is clearly a terrible way to keep a secret it\u2019s a great way to verify who encrypted the message, because only one person has the private key. Because of this, using a private key to encrypt a message is effectivel creating a digital signature which cannot be forged. (If the public key is used to encrypt a message then only the private key can be used to decrypt it, and this approach is used to transfer secret Back to the fruit. If Lizzie wants to accept John\u2019s IOU she can use public-key cryptograp and no-one needs to worry about Walter. There are 3 steps to 1] Create the IOU stating that John owes Lizzie 1\u00a0orange. Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange 2] John creates a public private key pair and encrypts the IOU using his private key. He adds an unencrypte \u201cFrom\u201d\u00a0lin From: John Date: 1234 To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key 3] John makes his public key freely available to anyone who wants\u00a0it. This will work because anybody (not just Lizzie) can check that John signed the IOU. The transactio can be verified by looking at the \u201cFrom\u201d part of that transactio noticing that this transactio is supposedly from John and then using John\u2019s public key to decrypt the encoded The signature can only be decrypted using John\u2019s public key if his private key was used to encrypt it. Because John is the only person with his private key, that proves the transactio is valid, and Lizzie isn\u2019t dishonestl creating a debt for John to\u00a0pay. Clearly if John discloses his private key (or its stolen) then he will make the system insecure, but this is a problem with John and his security protocols, not with Create and maintain an accurate list So far we\u2019ve seen how 1 IOU (for an orange) can be securely created, signed and verified. This process can extended to be used by more people to exchange more fruit. For\u00a0exampl The original\u00a0n From: John Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key Then some From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 Apples <- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key From: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 1 Banana <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key From: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 2 Bananas <- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key After these 4 transactio between John, Chris and\u00a0Lizzie John owes 1 orange to Lizzie and 1 banana to\u00a0Chris Lizzie owes 2 apples to\u00a0John Chris owes 2 bananas to\u00a0Lizzie. This is confusing, (and ridiculous It is not possible to know who is the most in debt or who is the most wealthy. Lizzie owes 2 apples, but is owed 2 bananas and 1 apple. Does that mean her fruit business is losing money or making money? We cannot say. To be able to know we need to use the same unit of value for all the fruits. Lets say that an orange is worth 2 apples, and a banana is also worth 2 apples (therefore 1 banana = 1 orange.), also lets invent a currency called \u201ccoins\u201d and say 1 apple is worth 1 coin. The 4 transactio can now be rewritten\u00a0 From: John // Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 2 coins <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 coins <- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key From: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 2 coins <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key From: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 4 coins <- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key By going through the list of transactio we can see\u00a0that: John owes Lizzie and Chris 2 coins each, and is owed 2 coins from Lizzie. His net amount is\u00a0-2 Lizzie owes John 2 coins but is owed 4 coins from Chris. Her net amount is\u00a0+2 Chris owes Lizzie 4 coins but is owed 2 coins from John. His net amount is\u00a0-2 So far Lizzie is the only person who appears to have any What if Lizzie wanted to use the 4 coins that she is owed by Chris to buy something from John? Could she use this system to transfer Chris\u2019 promise to pay her 4 coins so that Chris would pay John instead? The fact that everyone can be sure that the record of the transactio is accurate and authentic allows a debt to be used as payment. Lizzie\u2019s transactio would look like\u00a0this: From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: ba781... <- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key The \u201cWhat\u201d section contains a hash of the original transactio (with Chris) that she wants to transfer to John. A hash is the signature for a file or some text and in this case it is the signature for Lizzie\u2019s transactio with Chris. The signature is unique to each transactio and identifies which transactio is being used as payment. Because both transactio are signed using Lizzie\u2019s private key, it is simple to verify that Lizzie has the right to use this previous transactio where she is owed (or paid) some coins as payment to This shows how public-pri key infrastruc can be used to securely record transactio and enable trade between a group of people, - under certain conditions Blockchain can be used to transfer units of value like in this example, but we could just as easily put selfies or certificat of ownership (for houses, financial instrument diamonds, etc) inside the \u201cWhat\u201d part of the transactio If we make two other changes - removing the \u201cTo\u201d part of the transactio and including a hash of the transactio as part of the text which is signed using a private key. If we do this, then a record would\u00a0be: From: Chris // Date: 2345, What: \"A photo of me\" <- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key This would create a reliable record of what Chris claims he looks like. He can confidentl send anyone this record and if they have his public key then they can verify that it is Chris himself who signed it and is asserting that the photo is him. If somebody changed the photo then the data in the transactio would change and the transactio will have a new hash value. The new hash value will not match the hash value contained within the signature, and the text in the signature cannot be changed because it can only be encrypted using Chris\u2019 private key, which only Chris has. Therefore it will be simple to show that someone other than Chris is trying to change the\u00a0photo. Another use for public-key cryptograp arises if Chris were an employee in a bank, and the \u201cWhat\u201d contained documents about a customer the bank is providing financial services for. In this scenario, Chris (represent the bank) is effectivel confirming the customer\u2019s true identity and documentin the evidence that\u2019s been collected to show that the bank knows who their customer really is. If the transactio included a new section called \u201cCustomer ID\u201d (for example) then a database of all customers whose identity checks have been successful completed can be made. This can be shared with other department (or banks) easily and immutably. This is the concept behind KYC on a\u00a0blockcha Back to our fruit traders: At the moment a participan is allowed to carry a net negative balance. For this system to work in reality, the creation of \u201ccoins\u201d will need to be controlled in order to maintain their value. In the example above, people can freely create \u201ccoins\u201d and can also carry negative amounts of \u201ccoins\u201d. This would result in the value of a \u201ccoin\u201d plummeting Therefore their creation (and conversion from fruit) must be controlled in a Our examples so far only include 3 people. If there are a lot of people in the network it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to insist that everyone is present or online each time a new transactio is added to the list (the chain) of transactio However if we allow transactio to be added whilst some people are offline we create an opportunit for fraud. The reasons why, and the solution to this and other problems will be described in part 2."},{"title":"London Rent vs. London\u00a0Salaries","url":"london.html","body":"Living in London is expensive, everyone in the UK knows this.

During phase 1, 1 ETH would purchase 1100 \u00c6ons. In early April 2017, 1 ETH was worth about\u00a0\u00a338. I was willing to make a small and risky investment but in order to do that I would need to work out how to convert my convention Sterling into Bitcoin or Ether, in order to then purchase \u00c6ons.

When I was learning how to begin, I found Amy Hanlons blog particular useful and\u00a0clear. The learning\u00a0c \u2026 was longer than I expected. Since setting out to switch from Wordpress to Pelican, I\u2019ve taught myself enough of the following tools to hack this site together. I\u2019m really happy about this because these tools could be used in future projects\u00a0t HTML I find HTML quirky but intuitive. Tags make sense, comments are laborious and learning by google is relatively quick. Whatever it is I\u2019m trying to do (like add a link to jump back to the top of the page) someone will have posted the CSS Writing CSS feels a lot more concise that HTML but it also felt impossible to learn without taking a step back and reading an introducto course. Usually I learn by hacking new phrases together from existing examples so it was frustratin to go backwards before progressin There was a lightbulb moment when I realised CSS Selectors were a thing, and realising CSS files get called in the header (usually) of an HTML\u00a0file\u2026 I ended up using a trial subscripti to Thinkfuls Front-end developer course, which is pretty good at explaining how CSS is structured and how to arrange content on a page. If I still had access, I\u2019d be completing the second half of the course\u00a0:) Jinja is a tool written in Python to create HTML pages. It doesn\u2019t look intuitive to me, but I\u2019ve been able to get enough done by copy-pasti similar snippets from other parts of the theme I started with (Thanks Molivier!) to make the changes I wanted. I\u2019d like to learn more as it seems Pelican To build a website using Pelican, you need to run commands from the terminal. There are various commands but I found myself using only a few regularly. will generate a project skeleton to get you started. \u201cmake devserver\u201d will initialise a local server and generate output files so that I can view changes locally before uploading (its opposite is \u201cmake stopserver Finally \u201cpelican content -s generates the html and css for remote hosting. Some of the plugins I use such as \u201cAssets\u201d which minifies the CSS only work when publshconf is called, which confused me initially as I didn\u2019t think it was working when I was only using Git This really challenged me, and I still don\u2019t feel like I know what I\u2019m doing. Git is far more powerful than I need it to be, when all I want to do is undo some erroneous edits and upload a new version of the site to\u00a0Github. I can stage and commit files, I can create local and remote repo\u2019s from the command line. I can change a remote\u2019s URL, reset a repo and force a push or a pull. That\u2019s all. I haven\u2019t tried to merge or to create a test branch, and if some part of the process goes wrong it usually takes hours to make it right\u00a0agai This is one tool for which the awesome SO and Google cannot magic up the exact right answer For example, there is still an output folder in the source repo that is\u2026 mysterious to me. Its not the real output, its a version frozen in time from a few weeks ago, and it has an \u201c@\u201d in its name. I don\u2019t know how it got there. It was created one afternoon in a blur of frustrated google queries and I find git\u2019s commands the least intuitive of all the tools I use, with its preceeding single dashes and double dashes, and random words thrown into the middle of otherwise But Git is ubiquitous and Github is awesome, so I will learn\u00a0it. Github pages with an external URL You\u2019ll need to add a file called CNAME to the repo containing the output. CNAME should contain the address of your site in You\u2019ll also need to update the DNS records of your domain name to point the name at Github\u2019s servers. For Github, you need two \u201cA Records\u201d with host type \u201c@\u201d and values and respective You also need a CNAME record with host type \u201cwww\u201d and the value equal to It took about 12 hours for the changes to propagate, and during that time I had variable success loading the\u00a0site. Plugins One thing I didn\u2019t want when moving away from Wordpress was a site bloated with features that didn\u2019t make the content easier to read. However I found I still needed a few plugins to optimise my site and provide some basic functional that doesn\u2019t come with the Super useful, as all I need to do to publish a notebook as a webpage is copy the .ipynb file into the context directory and add a sidecar .ipynb-met file with standard meta data. This functional is one of the main reasons why Pelican is popular with data bloggers. (Though Nikola is Neighbors At the end of a post there should be a link to the previous and next blog posts - I was surprised this wasn\u2019t included as standard. After putting the plugin in the plugins folder and updating you need to copy a couple of jinja snippets into a template, and maybe add some css to make the links look\u00a0nice. Make those images as small as possible to help make the site as fast as possible. Add the plugin, update and thats\u00a0all. Assets Before I started working with Pelican, minifying css and JavaScript would have been too advanced. But once Pingdom and Google Pagespeed started criticisin me for my multiple .css files, I accepted the\u00a0challe Conclusion I\u2019m super happy wth the websites design and speed.

Before working in Vienna, I completed my Masters degree in Civil and Environmen Engineerin at the University of\u00a0Edinbur My research quantified the effects of changing the amount of gravity acting on granular materials as they poured out of a\u00a0silo. My PhD thesis and the short presentati I used when I defended\u00a0i Granular materials are a broard class of materials that are encountere everyday - salt, pills, breakfast cereal, sand, rice, soil, landslides salt are all granular materials. They are ubiquitous and occur in many different sizes and\u00a0variet Silos are a common type of container for storing granular materials. You pour the granular material in from the top, store it for a while, and then dispense the material in controlled quantities from the\u00a0bottom Research\u00a0f My research focussed on quantifyin how changes in gravity affected the material contained inside a silo, particular whilst the silo was being emptied. This is pertinent because engineers and scientists do not yet have a scientific understand of how granular materials behave. Whilst gravity clearly affects a granular materials, we cannot say exactly\u00a0ho This means we can\u2019t use analytical methods to quantify the physics that occur in a real system. Instead we use empirical methods guesses, and knowledge of what worked in previous similar situations This isn\u2019t necessaril bad, but it is less efficient and less reliable than an I built a small model silo (30cm tall) and put it into quite a large centrifuge (3 metre diameter). By rotating the model silo around the centre of the centrifuge at a constant speed I could simulate a higher gravity. I added high-speed cameras, pressure sensors and weighing scales so that I could measure how the material was moving once I opened the silo outlet and the silo began to empty. Photos of the experiment model I built can be seen\u00a0below I also programmed a computer model (using the commercial PFC 3D software and working in the FISH scripting language) to simulate and investigat if the same behaviours could be observed numericall as\u00a0physica The class of computer model I used is known as DEM (Discrete Element Modelling) These models work by considerin every grain of material individual usually as a sphere. If one sphere overlaps with another (i.e. the distance between the two particle centres is less than the sum of their radiuses) then a force proportion to the overlap size repels the two spheres away from each other. This simple approach is repeated over every grain or particle in the model, and produces life like behaviour in many situations It has many advantages over \u201ccontinuum based techniques that model groups of grains as if they were all just one big particle with unusual properties DEM has one massive limitation though. It requires huge amounts of computatio resources - and this limits its use in industrial scenarios outside. Until computers become much, much more powerful, DEM will only be used for theoretica research and Results When gravity increases by a factor of \\(x\\), both the discharge rate and local velocities within the silo increase by \\(\\sqrt(x) That\u2019s good to know if you\u2019re planning on storing stuff on the moon, but it\u2019s also a useful step towards explaining exactly why bulk granular materials behave the way they\u00a0do.

I wrote them to teach myself about encryption 1 To begin with the absolute basics, encryption generally works by taking a message and representi it as a series of numbers 2 which are then turned into a series of random looking numbers. Decryption works by turning the random looking numbers back into the Background The history of Cryptograp can be split into classical and modern eras. Modern cryptograp began in 1977 with the introducti of the RSA and Diffie-Hel algorithms Until then, Cryptograp required using a single key (the secret code) to encrypt and decrypt the message. This was transferre from sender to receiver secretly, but not In classical cryptograp the code is a shared\u00a0sec The modern era removed the requiremen for a shared secret and instead used number theory as a basis for quantifyin the strength of an encryption method. The strength of a modern cryptograp technique is quantifiab and provable by reference to number theory, rather than a users ability to transport or transfer a secret\u00a0cod Modern cryptograp is defined by Public Key Cryptograp systems. They use one key (code) for encryption and another for decryption The encryption key can be made public without any risk of the message being decrypted, and is therefore known as the public key. The key used to decrypt data is the private key, and must not be revealed. If a message is encrypted with the public key it can only be decrypted with the private\u00a0ke Public Key Cryptograp (PKC) systems use algorithms that are easy to process in one direction but difficult to reverse, which are known as mathematic trap-door functions. A simple example of a trap-door function is the product of two prime numbers. If two random prime numbers are chosen, it is trivial to find their product. However if only the product of the two numbers is known, it is relatively difficult to find either of the factors used to create the number (this is This was first noticed in 1874, when \u201cCan the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8,616,460, I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever\u00a0know. This simple problem shows that finding the product of two (secret) prime numbers is simple, but factorisin the result is not. This type of problem is a key feature of modern cryptograp Factoring prime numbers is a super famous mathematic problem, it was studied by Eratosthen 3 in the 3rd century BC and more recently the RSA Factoring Challenge has intended to track factorisat techniques by issues cash prizes for the factorisat of products of large\u00a0prim Generally, the bigger the difference in difficulty between executing the function and reversing it, the better the The RSA algorithm below uses factorisat as the foundation of its security, but factorisat is not the hardest problem to solve relative to the size of the keys required. Algorithms have been developed to factor the products of large prime numbers, and are much more efficient than randomly guessing possible factors. The greater the size of the primes being factored, the more efficient these algorithms become, and therefore the difference in difficulty between executing the function (multiplyi two large primes) and reversing it becomes smaller as the size of the cryptograp key length increases. This is a problem because as public key cryptograp becomes more commonly used the resources available to factor products of primes increases, and consequent larger keys are\u00a0requir Ultimately encryption techniques based on the difficulty of factorisat will become redundant as the difficulty gap between creating and solving them shrinks. A better trap door function is\u00a0require Overview of the RSA\u00a0algori Named after its founders (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), RSA was one of the first public-key encryption algorithms and is still widely\u00a0use RSA (as well as other cryptograp techniques makes use of a number line which loops back to zero after reaching a maximum value, rather than increasing indefinite This means that once a maximum number \\(n\\) has been defined, if a number greater than \\(n\\) is created the result simply loops around to 0 and begins counting from 0 again. i.e. if \\(n = 10\\), then \\(7 + 5 = 12 - 10 = 2\\). The result of a calculatio on a looping number line may easily be found by doing long division and using the remainder as the final answer, i.e. \\(12 / 10 = 1\\) with Generation of a pair of RSA\u00a0keys: 1. Generate the RSA\u00a0module Select two large random prime numbers, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). They need to be random because anyone who knows or guesses them will be able to decrypt Calculate \\(n =\u00a0pq\\) 2. Find derived number\u00a0(e) e must be greater than 1 and less than \\(( p - 1)( q - 1)\\). There must be no common factor for e and \\(( p - 1)( q - 1)\\) except for 1. 4 3. Form the public\u00a0key The pair of numbers \\((n, e)\\) form the public key and can be made\u00a0publi Even though \\(n\\) is public, it is so difficult to factor the product of 2 large prime numbers that an attacker would not be able to find its component primes in the time available. The strength of RSA rests entirely on the difficulty of factoring \\(n\\) into its two component prime\u00a0numb 4. Generate the private key\u00a0(d) The private key is generated from using \\(p\\), \\(q\\) and e as inputs to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. For a given set of values, there is a unique answer \\(d\\). \\(d\\) is the inverse of \\(e\\) modulo \\(( p - 1)( q - 1 )\\). This means that \\(d\\) is the number less than \\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\\) such that when it is multiplied by e, it is equal to \\(1\\) modulo \\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\\). RSA\u00a0exampl RSA does not directly operate on strings as bits, it operates on numbers modulo (less than) \\(n\\). and it is necessary to represent plain text as a series of numbers less than \\(n\\). The dominant encoding on the internet is UTF-8, which represents each upper case Latin letter as a number between 65 and 90. Using this encoding, a message \u201cHELLO\u201d would become \u201c\\(72, 69, 76, 76, 79\\)\u201d. The maximum number \\(n\\) needs to be the product of the two prime numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). For this example choose \\(p = 7\\) and \\(q = 13\\), so \\(n = 91\\) 5 The public key component e can be any number we choose, as long as there is no number other than 1 which is a common factor of e and \\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\\). In our example, this requires that there be no common factor between 72 and e other than 1, so let e \\(= 5\\). Therefore our public key is (91, 5). This can be made available to anyone without messages being decrypted because of the difficulty of factoring the product of (very large) prime\u00a0numb Using the fact that we know 5 and 11 are the prime factors of 55 and e is 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute our private key \\(d\\), which is\u00a029. Therefore when the prime factors 7 and 13 are used, the public key is (91, 5) and the private key is (91, 29). These parameters fully define a functional RSA\u00a0system Encoding To encode a letter H in a message (\u2018H\u2019 is \\(72\\) in UTF-8), we need to multiply it by itself \\(e\\) times (\\(e = 5\\)), rememberin to wrap around each time we pass our maximum value of \\(n = 91\\). \\(72 \\times 72 = 5184, 5184 / 91 = 56\\) with \\(88\\) remaining, (i.e. \\(5184 = 91 \\times 56 + 88\\)). Therefore: \\(72 \\times 72 = 5184 = 88\\) \\(88 \\times 72 = 6336 = 57\\) \\(57 \\times 72 = 4104 = 9\\) \\(9 \\times 72 = 648 =\u00a011\\) Therefore the encrypted value of \u201cH\u201d is \u201c\\(11\\)\u201c Using the method for each character in the message \u201cHELLO\u201d results in the encoded message To decrypt the message, we take each number and multiply it by itself \\(d\\) times, (\\(d=29\\)) wrapping around each time we pass \\(91\\). \\(11 \\times 11 = 121 = 30\\) \\(30 \\times 11 = 330 = 57\\) \u2026 \\(57 \\times 11 = 627 = 81\\) \\(81 \\times 11 = 891 =\u00a072\\) And we\u2019re back to our Files The spreadshee I used to calculate the encrypted and decrypted values can be downloaded here.

When a solution is found, a unit of currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin) is\u00a0generat If the currency represents nothing, why is it\u00a0valuabl Because people believe that in future, other people will believe it does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for\u00a0it. This is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies which also don\u2019t represent anything physical. (Although these examples are supported by laws In the past, creating a new currency without the support of government hasn\u2019t been A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new currency (otherwise people would create counterfei currency, decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards\u00a0ze An intermedia (a bank) was required for all large or remote transactio to make sure that the amount of money each party owns is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventin double spending of\u00a0funds) The technologi breakthrou was preventing double spending without requiring an intermedia This is made possible by using cryptograp techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful computers which have only recently Central and With convention currencies everyone\u2019s balance and transactio are recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much money each account has) and each account holder only has access to their own balance and transactio With digital currencies a copy of the entire ledger (every transactio ever made by everyone) is held on each computer (or node), and anyone can see if two parties wish to make a remote transactio then they need a bank to be the intermedia The bank mediates by updating the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds as a result of the transactio This is how one party knows if the counter-pa is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must be involved in every transactio between its account holders. This need for an intermedia increases the complexity and cost of Sending\u00a0mo To send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in your account should decrease and the amount in another account should increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this message will check its authentici make the changes, and pass the message along to other\u00a0node What problems does For a transactio to be accepted and entered into the distribute ledger, its authentici needs to be verified. Because the ledger is distribute everyone can see everyone else\u2019s transactio Therefore user authentica and transactio authorisat needs to be possible without compromisi a user\u2019s ability to send secure payments in\u00a0future. There is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is neither physical, printed or representa of anything, how do you prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply creating as much new currency as they\u00a0want? Another problem is the addition of new transactio to the ledger from many unrelated users. If each party has their own copy of the ledger, updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers completene and accuracy be assured?

I read through the new testament repeatedly and read most of the old testament during this time. I knew the scriptures well enough that a lot of sermons became boring and obvious - I\u2019d already studied the bible passage being used. During this time I remember being aware that the way I thought was different to how it would have been otherwise. My perspectiv were long-term and less me focused. I thought about what I was reading instead of the days\u2019 headlines or social chatter. I remember enjoying the benefits and thinking that I should keep this habit. The reasons why I think Christiani is so wonderful are well summarised in this sermon. It\u2019s now 10 years later, and whilst my conviction are strong, my knowledge of the bible is sadly pretty fuzzy. My thinking is clouded by the perspectiv contained in the media I consume and the conversati I\u2019m part of. I strongly suspect I would be acting and thinking differentl if I read my bible more, but I don\u2019t know what those difference would be. Trouble is, it\u2019s often not obvious what the immediate benefits of reading the bible are, you have to work for it a bit. Praying for help is effective. The books in the bible were written to last through the ages and across all cultures, so it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re not as easy to read as something written for an English speaker in a hurry.

It\u2019s in R, and I want to focus on Python, but I\u2019d still like to do it. I need to consider the opportunit cost of the time \u201cRead for fun, history, fiction\u201d - When I started my job, in April 2014, I was half way through Savage Continent, which is an eye-openin and eye-wateri history of Europe in the years after World War 2. I see Europe through different eyes because of it. However I only got half way though, and since April \u201814 I never felt I had the free time or energy to pick it back up. This should change. When I was a researcher and when I was a student, I had so much more opportunit to develop my own pursuits. Since entering the corporate world, I find myself fighting a war of attrition to exert my personalit onto my\u00a0lifesty Read for fiction\u2026 I\u2019m unconvince What do you have at the end of it? What can you do with it? Maybe I\u2019ve just been reading the wrong authors, but I\u2019m going to leave this for now. Sure, you could gain an appreciati of a different time or place, but that appreciati comes via the fictional characters and events, its secondary. What about abstract constructs perspectiv morals\u2026 things that history books are ill-suited for? Great fiction would be essential for exploring these. But for now, I\u2019ll prioritise point\u00a03. \u201cDo a photograph project\u201d - This I would love to do, but probably won\u2019t. It would be a luxury, and the opportunit cost would be too great right now. I\u2019d like to shoot a series of black and white portraits, and turn them into large prints. I think good portrait photograph is uniquely impactful and moving, choosing B&W removes distractio and leaves a subjects humanity more\u00a0expos \u201cHave a list of ideas\u201d - There\u2019s no excuse for this one, anyone can have several good ideas. It\u2019s turning them into reality that takes skill. Need to have the ideas first,\u00a0tho \u201cDo a law MOOC\u201d - i.e Study particular areas of law, in my own time and at my own pace. I studied a tiny bit of law during the ACA, and realised employment law or contract law could be really useful. (Same for the tax system - another surprise). We only had a brief introducti though, so if I could find the time I\u2019d like to know\u00a0more. \u201cDo an InfoSec or Network Security MOOC\u201d - Its super interestin but not likely to be a good use of\u00a0time. \u201cLearn to fight - Krav Maga / MMA\u201d - Ever since watching The Bourne Identity I\u2019ve wanted to learn Krav Maga, and Georges St-Pierre made me want to train for MMA. For now though, I\u2019ll do P90x. I can reconsider in 90\u00a0days. \u201cGet out of London\u201d - My contract ends in April 2017, next summer will be a crossroads I hate the commute, I hate being constantly rushed.

As a pragmatic engineer, it seemed clear to me what the next widget should do: If my first widget calculated the time since an event, the next should calculate the time until an event. I set out to create the companion to \u201cTime Since\u201d and improve upon the My first code design choice was to cut out the use of an Apple Script and calculated everything in one CoffeeScri file. It would be more efficient and easier to\u00a0read. Unfortunat I soon began to realise why the original widget I\u2019d based \u201cTime Since\u201d on had used AppleScrip to calculate the time elapsed. Date-Times are fiddly to work with in many languages, and this is true in My code began to look increasing like spaghetti as I tried to achieve 6 key\u00a0featur Calculate the number of months and days between two dates (complicat by the varying number of days in Add the option to specify the level of detail in the output text (to the minute, to the hour, to the day,\u00a0etc.) Remove any 0 amounts from the output (\u201c2 Months and 5 Hours\u201d not \u201c2 Months, 0 Days and 5\u00a0Hours\u201d) Add the option to abbreviate times (\u2018years\u2019 \u2192 \u2018y\u2019, \u2018hours\u2019 \u2192 \u2018h\u2019, \u2018and\u2019 \u2192 \u2018&\u2019,\u00a0etc.) Output a grammatica correct sentence (correct pluralisat and comma separated terms, with an \u201cand\u201d between the last two\u00a0terms) Prepend and append users After a few frustratin hours, it was clear that it would be a lot easier to modify the existing AppleScrip rather than reinvent the wheel in JavaScript I decided to use it instead of using only JavaScript as I knew the AppleScrip file could correctly consider the number of days in the months between the 2 dates (feature 1), and it contains a function to pluralise the correct parts of the string (feature\u00a05 The remaining features were added by using a combinatio of if statements and arrays. The if statements simply ask if an amount is equal to zero. If not, then it\u2019s appended to an array of terms to include in the output. At the end of this code chunk it\u2019s possible to ask how many non-zero terms to include in the output. An array with length one less than the number of output terms is created and filled with commas with an \u2018and\u2019 in the The two arrays are combined in the correct order by looping through the index of the longer array and appending each term to a final array. The final array is the\u00a0output \u2018Time Until\u2018 can be downloaded from the \u00dcbersicht widgets gallery. I think another useful feature would be an option to specify the output only in terms of a chosen amount, such as weeks or days.

If you do the courses in order then prior knowledge isn\u2019t required, and I think the courses strike a good balance of brevity and\u00a0depth. The main downside to me is that the courses exclusivel use R (which is popular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more popular in\u00a0Industr Each course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data science, such as statistica inference or machine learning.
