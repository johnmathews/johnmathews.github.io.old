        <p>This is a list of interests I want to consider pursuing. I wrote it when
I began to study for my last set of exams and my mind filled with things
I'd rather be doing instead. Some of these interests are just me
reacting to having no free-time for a few months, but others are decent
goals and projects. Temporarily losing my spare time made me value it
more.</p>
<p><img alt="free-time" src="http://johnmathews.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_6858-e1472754142821-1024x1024.jpg">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-956 .size-large width="1024" height="1024"}</p>
<p>I wrote this post so that I could compare what I thought was important
when I was busy and when I wasn't. Writing the list allowed me to move
on without forgetting. Here's a break down of each item:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Run 10k in 50 minutes" - This is easier than I imagined. When I
wrote the list I could barely run 2k without stopping, but intended
to go for a weekly run whilst studying. I've struggled to stay
energetic and healthy during previous exam phases, so now I have a
rule that I must do some mild exercise even if I think I can't spare
the time. I find running really lowers my stress levels, and
increasing my heart rate and working up a sweat lets me sleep better
and concentrate for longer. After a few weeks of minimal running, I
could run 5k easily. If I kept at it, 10k in 50 mins would be
easy. But point 2...</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Be Insanity strong" - As in, do the Insanity workout programme.
Again. I thought about it and decided to do
<a href="http://johnmathews.eu/p90x/">P90x</a> instead. Week 1 is going
great...</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Read the bible habitually" - When I was 17 I found out about Jesus
and became a Christian. In the months and years after that I'd
regularly read my bible almost every day and pray a lot. I wanted to
understand, so I set a goal of 5 chapters each day.</p>
<p>I read through the new testament repeatedly and read most of the old
testament during this time. I knew the scriptures well enough that a
lot of sermons became boring and obvious - I'd already studied the
bible passage being used. During this time I remember being aware
that the way I thought was different to how it would have been
otherwise. My perspectives were long-term and less me focused. I
thought about what I was reading instead of the days' headlines or
social chatter. I remember enjoying the benefits and thinking that I
should keep this habit. The reasons why I think Christianity is so
wonderful are well summarised in
<a href="http://messages.destinyedinburgh.com/sermon/the-gospel-we-preach-a-message-for-leaders">this</a>
sermon.</p>
<p>It's now 10 years later, and whilst my convictions are strong, my
knowledge of the bible is sadly pretty fuzzy. My thinking is clouded
by the perspectives contained in the media I consume and the
conversations I'm part of. I strongly suspect I would be acting and
thinking differently if I read my bible more, but I don't know what
those differences would be. Trouble is, it's often not obvious what
the immediate benefits of reading the bible are, you have to work
for it a bit. Praying for help is effective. The books in the bible
were written to last through the ages and across all cultures, so
it's not surprising that they're not as easy to read as something
written for an English speaker in a hurry. I should stop being in a
hurry, and stop prioritising only quantifiable goals.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Think more" - On a similar note to 3, but less supernatural. If I
spent less time consuming content and a little more looking around
me or walking, I reckon I'd be more self-aware and make better
decisions. This would probably lead to a happier, more satisfying
life.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Pray more" - I don't know why, but the creator of the universe
wants me to talk and share my life with him. He cares about me. This
makes no sense to me, at all. If I was God, I would not go out of my
way to consider the views and concerns of a very flawed human. But
when I pray, my prayers are very often answered. I should ask him
about this.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Amazon seller?" - Amazon have this "Fulfilled by Amazon" service,
which means you don't even need to hold the stock you want to sell.
If I choose the right products, import them cheaply from China and
reselling  them on Amazon at a profit, I end up quids in for minimal
effort and manageable risk. Sounds intriguing.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Blog about interesting data" - Here I am, blogging. I should stick
to the main topic and get technical. I was inspired by this
<a href="http://www.curiousgnu.com/">blog</a> in particular.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Finish Coursera" - The<a href="http://johnmathews.eu/courseras-data-science-specialisation/">data science
specialization</a>
is great! It's in R, and I want to focus on Python, but I'd still
like to do it. I need to consider the opportunity cost of the time
committed, though.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Read for fun, history, fiction" - When I started my job, in April
2014, I was half way through <a href="https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B00796LLLK&amp;asin=B00796LLLK&amp;preview=newtab&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4">Savage
Continent</a>,
which is an eye-opening and eye-watering history of Europe in the
years after World War 2. I see Europe through different eyes because
of it. However I only got half way though, and since April '14 I
never felt I had the free time or energy to pick it back up. This
should change. When I was a researcher, and when I was a student, I
had so much more opportunity to develop my own pursuits. Since
entering the corporate world, I find myself fighting a war of
attrition to exert my personality onto my lifestyle.</p>
<p>Read for fiction... I'm unconvinced. What do you have at the end of
it? What can you do with it? Maybe I've just been reading the wrong
authors, but I'm going to leave this for now. Sure, you could
gain an appreciation of a different time or place, but that
appreciation comes via the fictional characters and events, its
secondary. What about abstract constructs, perspectives, morals...
things that history books are ill-suited for? Great fiction would be
essential for exploring these. But for now, I'll prioritise point 3.</p>

</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Do a photography project" - This I would love to do, but probably
won't. It would be a luxury, and the opportunity cost would be too
great right now. I'd like to shoot a series of black and white
portraits, and turn them into large prints. I think good portrait
photography is uniquely impactful and moving, choosing B&amp;W removes
distractions and leaves a subjects humanity more exposed.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Have a list of business/product ideas" - There's no excuse for this
one, anyone can have several good ideas. It's turning them into
reality that takes skill. Need to have the ideas first, though.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Do a law MOOC" - i.e Study particular areas of law, in my own time
and at my own pace. I studied a tiny bit of law during the ACA, and
realised employment law or contract law could be really useful.
(Same for the tax system - another surprise). We only had a brief
introduction though, so if I could find the time I'd like to know
more.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>

<p>"Do an InfoSec or Network Security MOOC" - Its super interesting,
but not likely to be a good use of time.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<p>"Learn to fight - Krav Maga / MMA" - Ever since watching The Bourne
    Identity I've wanted to learn Krav Maga, and <a href="https://youtu.be/LybrzdG96_8">Georges
    St-Pierre</a> made me want to train
    for MMA. For now though, I'll do P90x. I can reconsider in 90 days.

</li>
<li>"Get out of London" - My contract ends in April 2017, next summer
    will be a crossroads. I hate the commute, I hate being constantly
    rushed. Living in other cities has been a lot more pleasant.</li>
