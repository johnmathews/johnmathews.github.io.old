        <h1>Encryption</h1>
<p>Blockchain uses Elliptical Curve Cryptography (<span class="caps">ECC</span>) to authenticate
users and authorise transactions. These notes introduce the field of
cryptography and explains how modern cryptographic methods
work. I wrote them to teach myself about encryption<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>To begin with the absolute basics, encryption generally works by
taking a message and representing it as a series of numbers<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> which are then turned into a series of
random looking numbers. Decryption works by turning the random looking
numbers back into the original&nbsp;message.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The history of Cryptography can be split into classical and modern eras.
Modern cryptography began in 1977 with the introduction of the <span class="caps">RSA</span> and
Diffie-Hellman algorithms.  Until then, Cryptography required using a
single key (the secret code) to encrypt and decrypt the message. This
was transferred from sender to receiver secretly, but not
cryptographically. In classical cryptography, the code is a <em>shared</em>&nbsp;secret.</p>
<p>The modern era removed the requirement for a shared secret and instead
used number theory as a basis for quantifying the strength of an
encryption method. The strength of a modern cryptographic technique is
quantifiable and provable by reference to number theory, rather than a
users ability to transport or transfer a secret&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Modern cryptography is defined by Public Key Cryptographic systems. They
use one key (code) for encryption and another for decryption. The
encryption key can be made public without any risk of the message being
decrypted, and is therefore known as the public key. The key used to
decrypt data is the private key, and must not be revealed. A message can
only be encrypted with the public key, and decryption only with the
private&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>Public Key Cryptographic systems use algorithms that are easy to process
in one direction but difficult to reverse, which are known as
mathematical trap-door functions. A simple example of a trap-door
function is the product of two prime numbers. If two random prime
numbers are chosen, it is trivial to find their product. However if only
the product of the two numbers is known, it is relatively difficult to
find either of the factors used to create the number (this is
factorisation). This was first noticed in 1874, when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons#Jevons.27_number">Jevons</a>&nbsp;remarked:</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce
the number 8,616,460,799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself
will ever&nbsp;know.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This simple problem shows that finding the product of two (secret) prime
numbers is computationally simple, but factorising the result is not.
This type of problem is a key feature of modern cryptography. Factoring
prime numbers is a super famous mathematical problem, it was studied
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a><sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> in the 3rd century <span class="caps">BC</span> and
more recently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge"><span class="caps">RSA</span> Factoring Challenge</a> has
intended to track state-of-the-art factorisation techniques by issues
cash prizes for the factorisation of large&nbsp;primes.</p>
<p>Generally, the bigger the difference in difficulty between executing the
function and reversing it, the better the cryptographic&nbsp;technique.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">RSA</span> algorithm below uses factorisation as the foundation of its
security, but factorisation is not the hardest problem to solve relative
to the size of the keys required. Algorithms have been developed to
factor large prime numbers which are much more efficient than randomly
guessing possible factors. The greater the size of the prime being
factored, the more efficient these algorithms become, and therefore the
difference in difficulty between executing the function (multiplying two
large primes) and reversing it (factorisation) becomes smaller as the
size of the cryptographic key length increases. This is a problem
because as public key cryptography becomes more commonly used the
resources available to factor primes increases, and consequently larger
keys are&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>Ultimately, encryption techniques based on the difficulty of prime
factorisation will become redundant as the difficulty gap between
creating and solving them shrinks. A better trap door function is&nbsp;required.</p>
<h2>Overview of the <span class="caps">RSA</span>&nbsp;algorithm</h2>
<p>Named after its founders (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest" title="Ron Rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir" title="Adi Shamir">Adi
Shamir</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman" title="Leonard Adleman">Leonard Adleman</a>),
<span class="caps">RSA</span> was one of the first public-key encryption algorithms and is still
widely used. The asymmetry of encoding with a public key and decrypting
with a different (private) key is based on the difficulty of factoring
the product of two large prime&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RSA</span> (as well as other cryptographic techniques) makes use of a number
line which loops back to zero after reaching a maximum value, rather
than increasing indefinitely. This means that once a maximum number
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> has been defined, if a number greater than <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is created, the
result simply loops around to 0 and begins counting from 0 again. i.e.
if <span class="math">\(n = 10\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(7 + 5 = 12 - 10 = 2\)</span>. The result of a calculation
on a looping number line may be easily found by doing long division and
using the remainder as the final answer, i.e. <span class="math">\(12 / 10 = 1\)</span> with <span class="math">\(2\)</span>&nbsp;remaining.</p>
<h2>Generation of a pair of <span class="caps">RSA</span>&nbsp;keys:</h2>
<h2>1. Generate the <span class="caps">RSA</span>&nbsp;modulus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select two large random prime numbers, <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span>. They need to
    be random because anyone who knows or guesses them will be able to
    decrypt the&nbsp;encryption.</li>
<li>Calculate <span class="math">\(n =&nbsp;pq\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Find derived number&nbsp;(e)</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>e</em> must be greater than 1 and less than <span class="math">\(( p - 1)( q -&nbsp;1)\)</span></li>
<li>There must be no common factor for e and <span class="math">\(( p - 1)
    ( q - 1)\)</span> except for 1[1. If this is the case then
    e and <span class="math">\(( p - 1) ( q - 1 )\)</span> are called&nbsp;&#8220;coprime&#8221;].</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Form the public&nbsp;key</h2>
<ul>
<li>The pair of numbers <span class="math">\((n, e)\)</span> form the public key and can be made&nbsp;public</li>
<li>Even though <span class="math">\(n\)</span><em> </em>is public, it is so difficult to factor a large
    prime number that an attacker would not be able to find its
    component primes in the time available. The strength of <span class="caps">RSA</span> rests
    entirely on the difficulty of factoring <span class="math">\(n\)</span> into its two component
    prime&nbsp;numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Generate the private key&nbsp;(d)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The private key is generated from using <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and e as inputs
    to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. For a given set of values,
    there is a unique answer <span class="math">\(d\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="math">\(e\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(( p - 1)( q - 1 )\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the number less
    than <span class="math">\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\)</span> such
    that when it is multiplied by e, it is equal to <span class="math">\(1\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1&nbsp;)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">RSA</span>&nbsp;example:</h2>
<p><span class="caps">RSA</span> does not directly operate on strings as bits, it operates on numbers
modulo (less than) <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. and it is necessary to represent plain text as
a series of numbers less than <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. The dominant encoding on the
internet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><span class="caps">UTF</span>-8</a>, which
represents each upper case Latin letter as a number between 65 and 90.
Using this encoding, a message &#8220;<span class="caps">HELLO</span>&#8221; would become &#8220;<span class="math">\(72, 69, 76, 76,
79\)</span><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>.</p>
<p>The maximum number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> needs to be the product of the two prime
numbers <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span>. For this example choose <span class="math">\(p = 7\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q =
13\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(n  = 91\)</span><sup id="fnref-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The public key component <em>e</em> can be any number we choose,  as long as
there is no number other than 1 which is a common factor of
<em>e</em> and <span class="math">\(( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )\)</span>. In our
example, this requires that there be no common factor between
72 and e other than 1, so let <em>e</em> <span class="math">\(= 5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore our public key is (91, 5). This can be made available to
anyone without messages being decrypted because of the difficulty of
factoring a (very large) prime&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>Using the fact that we know 5 and 11 are the prime factors of 55 and e
is 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm  to compute our
private key <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, which is&nbsp;29.</p>
<p>Therefore when the prime factors 7 and 13 are used, the public key is
(91, 5) and the private key is (91, 29). These parameters fully define a
functional <span class="caps">RSA</span>&nbsp;system.</p>
<h3>Encoding</h3>
<p>To encode the first letter of our short and unimaginative message (&#8216;H&#8217;,
which is <span class="math">\(72\)</span> in <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8), we need to multiply it by itself <em>e </em>times
(<span class="math">\(e = 5\)</span>), remembering to wrap around each time we pass our maximum
value of <span class="math">\(n = 91\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(72 \times 72 = 5184, 5184 / 91 = 56\)</span> with <span class="math">\(88\)</span> remaining, (i.e.
<span class="math">\(5184 = 91 \times 56 + 88\)</span>). 
Therefore <span class="math">\(72 \times 72 = 5184 = 88\)</span>
<span class="math">\(88 \times 72 = 6336 = 57\)</span>
<span class="math">\(57 \times 72 = 4104 = 9\)</span>
<span class="math">\(9 \times 72 = 648 =&nbsp;11\)</span></p>
<p>Therefore the encrypted value of &#8220;H&#8221; is &#8220;<span class="math">\(11\)</span><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Using the method for each character in the message &#8220;<span class="caps">HELLO</span>&#8221; results in
the encoded message &#8220;\<span class="math">\(11,62,20,20,53\\)</span><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>.</p>
<p>To decrypt the message, we take each number and multiply it by itself
<span class="math">\(d\)</span> times, (<span class="math">\(d=29\)</span>) wrapping around each time we pass <span class="math">\(91\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(11 \times 11 = 121 =&nbsp;30\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(30 \times 11 = 330 =&nbsp;57\)</span></p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><span class="math">\(57 \times 11 = 627 =&nbsp;81\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(81 \times 11 = 891 =&nbsp;72\)</span></p>
<p>And we&#8217;re back to our original&nbsp;encoding.</p>
