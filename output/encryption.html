        <p>[Blockchain uses Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) to authenticate
users and authorise transactions. These notes introduce the field of
cryptography and explains how modern cryptographic methods
work. ]{style="line-height: 1.5;"}I wrote them to teach myself about
encryption[1. I used the
explanations <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/public_key_encryption.htm">here</a>
and
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">here</a> a
lot].</p>
<p>To begin with the the absolute basics, encryption generally works by
taking a message and representing it as a series of numbers[2. A simple
example is \$A=1, B=2\$ etc] which are then turned into a series of
random looking numbers. Decryption works by turning the random looking
numbers back into the original message.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The history of Cryptography can be split into classical and modern eras.
Modern cryptography began in 1977 with the introduction of the RSA and
Diffie-Hellman algorithms.  Until then, Cryptography required using a
single key (the secret code) to encrypt and decrypt the message. This
was transferred from sender to receiver secretly, but not
cryptographically. In classical cryptography, the code is a <em>shared</em>
secret.</p>
<p>The modern era removed the requirement for a shared secret and instead
used number theory as a basis for quantifying the strength of an
encryption method. The strength of a modern cryptographic technique is
quantifiable and provable by reference to number theory, rather than a
users ability to transport or transfer a secret code.</p>
<p>Modern cryptography is defined by Public Key Cryptographic systems. They
use one key (code) for encryption and another for decryption. The
encryption key can be made public without any risk of the message being
decrypted, and is therefore known as the public key. The key used to
decrypt data is the private key, and must not be revealed. A message can
only be encrypted with the public key, and decryption only with the
private key.</p>
<p>Public Key Cryptographic systems use algorithms that are easy to process
in one direction but difficult to reverse, which are known as
mathematical trap-door functions. A simple example of a trap-door
function is the product of two prime numbers. If two random prime
numbers are chosen, it is trivial to find their product. However if only
the product of the two numbers is known, it is relatively difficult to
find either of the factors used to create the number (this is
factorisation). This was first noticed in 1874, when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons#Jevons.27_number">Jevons</a>
remarked:</p>
<p><em>"Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce
the number 8,616,460,799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself
will ever know."</em></p>
<p>This simple problem shows that finding the product of two (secret) prime
numbers is computationally simple, but factorising the result is not.
This type of problem is a key feature of modern cryptography. Factoring
prime numbers is a super famous mathematical problem, it was studied
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a>[1.
Eratosthenes invented his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">sieving
algorithm</a> which
finds all the primes up to a given limit] in the 3^rd^ century BC and
more recently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge">RSA Factoring
Challenge</a> has
intended to track state-of-the-art factorisation techniques by issues
cash prizes for the factorisation of large primes.</p>
<p>Generally, the bigger the difference in difficulty between executing the
function and reversing it, the better the cryptographic technique.</p>
<p>The RSA algorithm below uses factorisation as the foundation of its
security, but factorisation is not the hardest problem to solve relative
to the size of the keys required. Algorithms have been developed to
factor large prime numbers which are much more efficient than randomly
guessing possible factors. The greater the size of the prime being
factored, the more efficient these algorithms become, and therefore the
difference in difficulty between executing the function (multiplying two
large primes) and reversing it (factorisation) becomes smaller as the
size of the cryptographic key length increases. This is a problem
because as public key cryptography becomes more commonly used the
resources available to factor primes increases, and consequently larger
keys are required.</p>
<p>Ultimately, encryption techniques based on the difficulty of prime
factorisation will become redundant as the difficulty gap between
creating and solving them shrinks. A better trap door function is
required.</p>
<h3>Overview of the RSA algorithm</h3>
<p>Named after its founders (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest" title="Ron Rivest">Ron
Rivest</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir" title="Adi Shamir">Adi
Shamir</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman" title="Leonard Adleman">Leonard
Adleman</a>),
RSA was one of the first public-key encryption algorithms and is still
widely used. The asymmetry of encoding with a public key and decrypting
with a different (private) key is based on the difficulty of factoring
the product of two large prime numbers.</p>
<p>RSA (as well as other cryptographic techniques) makes use of a number
line which loops back to zero after reaching a maximum value, rather
than increasing indefinitely. This means that once a maximum number
\$n\$ has been defined, if a number greater than \$n\$ is created, the
result simply loops around to 0 and begins counting from 0 again. i.e.
if \$n = 10\$, then \$7 + 5 = 12 - 10 = 2\$. The result of a calculation
on a looping number line may be easily found by doing long division and
using the remainder as the final answer, i.e. \$12/10 = 1\$ with \$2\$
remaining.</p>
<h4>Generation of a pair of RSA keys:</h4>
<h5>1. Generate the RSA modulus</h5>
<ul>
<li>Select two large random prime numbers, \$p\$ and \$q\$. They need to
    be random because anyone who knows or guesses them will be able to
    decrypt the encryption.</li>
<li>Calculate \$n = pq\$</li>
</ul>
<h5>2. Find derived number (e)</h5>
<ul>
<li><em>e</em> must be greater than 1 and less than \$\left( p - 1 \right)
    \left( q - 1 \right)\$</li>
<li>There must be no common factor for e and \$ \left( p - 1 \right)
    \left( q - 1 \right)\$ except for 1[1. If this is the case then
    e and \$latex \left( p - 1 \right) \left( q - 1 \right)\$ are
    called "coprime"].</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Form the public key</h5>
<ul>
<li>The pair of numbers \$(n, e)\$<em> </em>form the public key and can be made
    public</li>
<li>Even though \$n\$<em> </em>is public, it is so difficult to factor a large
    prime number that an attacker would not be able to find its
    component primes in the time available. The strength of RSA rests
    entirely on the difficulty of factoring \$n\$ into its two component
    prime numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h5>4. Generate the private key (d)</h5>
<ul>
<li>The private key is generated from using \$p\$, \$q\$ and e as inputs
    to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. For a given set of values,
    there is a unique answer \$d\$</li>
<li>\$d\$ is the inverse of  e modulo \$latex \left( p - 1 \right)
    \left( q - 1 \right)\$. This means that \$d\$ is the number less
    than \$latex \left( p - 1 \right) \left( q - 1 \right)\$ such
    that when it is multiplied by e, it is equal to 1 modulo \$latex
    \left( p - 1 \right) \left( q - 1 \right)\$</li>
</ul>
<h4>RSA example:</h4>
<p>RSA does not directly operate on strings as bits, it operates on numbers
modulo (less than) \$n\$. and it is necessary to represent plaintext as
a series of numbers less than \$n\$. The dominant encoding on the
internet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>, which
represents each upper case latin letter as a number between 65 and 90.
Using this encoding, a message "HELLO" would become "\$72, 69, 76, 76,
79\$".</p>
<p>The maximum number \$n\$ needs to be the product of the two prime
numbers \$p\$ and \$q\$. For this example choose \$p = 7\$ and \$q =
13\$, so \$n  = 91\$[1. Whilst the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is
apparently simple to compute, its description is not. Therefore I've
used the same numbers in the following example as in the tutorials
<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/public_key_encryption.htm">here</a>
and
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">here</a>.].</p>
<p>The public key component <em>e</em> can be any number we choose,  as long as
there is no number other than 1 which is a common factor of
<em>e</em> and \$\left( p - 1 \right) \left( q - 1 \right)\$. In our
example, this requires that there be no common factor between
72 and e other than 1, so let <em>e</em> \$= 5\$.</p>
<p>Therefore our public key is (91, 5). This can be made available to
anyone without messages being decrypted because of the difficulty of
factoring a (very large) prime number.</p>
<p>Using the fact that we know 5 and 11 are the prime factors of 55 and e
is 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm  to compute our
private key \$d\$, which is 29.</p>
<p>Therefore when the prime factors 7 and 13 are used, the public key is
(91, 5) and the private key is (91, 29). These parameters fully define a
functional RSA system.</p>
<h5>Encoding</h5>
<p>To encode the first letter of our short and unimaginative message ('H',
which is \$72\$ in UTF-8), we need to multiply it by itself <em>e </em>times
(\$e = 5\$), remembering to wrap around each time we pass our maximum
value of \$n = 91\$.</p>
<p>\$72 \times 72 = 5184, 5184 / 91 = 56\$ with \$88\$ remaining, (i.e.
\$5184 = 91 \times 56 + 88\$). Therefore \$72 \times 72 = 5184 = 88 \$</p>
<p>\$88 \times 72 = 6336 = 57\$</p>
<p>\$57 \times 72 = 4104 = 9\$</p>
<p>\$9 \times 72 = 648 = 11\$</p>
<p>Therefore the encrypted value of "H" is "\$11\$"</p>
<p>Using the method for each character in the message "HELLO" results in
the encoded message "\$11,62,20,20,53\$".</p>
<p>To decrypt the message, we take each number and multiply it by itself
\$d\$ times, (\$d=29\$) wrapping around each time we pass \$91\$.</p>
<p>\$11 \times 11 = 121 = 30\$</p>
<p>\$30 \times 11 = 330 = 57\$</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>\$57 \times 11 = 627 = 81\$</p>
<p>\$81 \times 11 = 891 = 72\$</p>
<p>And we're back to our original encoding.</p>
