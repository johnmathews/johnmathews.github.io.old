        <h1>Coursera's Data Science Specialisation</h1>
<p>Last year I decided to learn the tools required to work as a data
scientist. I was confident I already had the mathematical and analysis
skills I needed, but I wasn't familiar with the tools of the trade.</p>
<p>Some googling brought me to Coursera, and the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">Data Science
Specialisation</a>
run by Johns Hopkins University.  It consists of 9 courses, and so far
I've completed five. If you do the courses in order then prior knowledge
isn't required, and I think the courses strike a good balance of brevity
and depth.</p>
<p>The main downside to me is that the courses exclusively use R (which is
popular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more
popular in Industry).  </p>
<p>Each course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data
science, such as statistical inference or machine learning. Key concepts
and tools in each subject are explained and developed, and whilst it's
not as thorough as a longer course would be, there is more than enough
material packed into the lectures, quizzes, assignments and projects to
apply to real applications.</p>
<p>I've read that the second half of the specialisation is a lot more
technical than the first, so I'm looking forward to setting aside some
time, working through the assignments and acquiring some useful skills!</p>
