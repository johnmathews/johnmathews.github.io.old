        <h1>Digital currencies: the&nbsp;basics</h1>
<p>Digital currencies are often discussed in the context of finance,
technology and economics. The Blockchain - the technology which
applications like Bitcoin are built on - is significant because it
removes the need for trust or an intermediary between unrelated parties
transacting with each other. So far, the most influential and famous
digital currency is&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This post is intended to introduce the basic concepts of digital
currencies and the problems a distributed ledger system needs to&nbsp;overcome.</p>
<h2>What is a digital&nbsp;currency?</h2>
<p>A digital currency is an internet based medium of exchange. Units of
digital currency are not printed, are not physical, and represent
nothing. A unit of currency is produced by running algorithms to solve
complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a unit of
currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin) is&nbsp;generated.</p>
<h2>If the currency represents nothing, why is it&nbsp;valuable?</h2>
<p>Because people believe that in future, other people will believe
it does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services
in exchange for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies)
which also don&#8217;t represent anything physical. (Although these examples
are  supported by laws or&nbsp;regulation).</p>
<p>In the past, creating a new currency without the support of government
hasn&#8217;t been practical&nbsp;because:</p>
<ol>
<li>A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new
    currency (otherwise people would create counterfeit currency,
    decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards&nbsp;zero)</li>
<li>An intermediary (a bank) was required for all large or remote
    transactions, to make sure that the amount of money each party
    owns is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventing
    double spending of&nbsp;funds)</li>
</ol>
<p>The technological breakthrough was preventing double spending without
requiring an intermediary. This is made possible by using cryptographic
techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful
computers which have only recently become&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2>Central and distributed&nbsp;ledgers</h2>
<p>With conventional currencies everyone&#8217;s balance and transactions are
recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much money each
account has) and each account holder only has access to their own
balance and transactions. With digital currencies, a copy of the entire
ledger (every transaction ever made by everyone) is held on each
computer (or node), and anyone can see everyone&#8217;s&nbsp;transactions.</p>
<p>Conventionally, if two parties wish to make a remote transaction then
they need a bank to be the intermediary. The bank mediates by
updating the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds
as a result of the transaction. This is how one party knows if the
counter-party is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is
only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must
be involved in every transaction between its account holders. This
need for an intermediary increases the complexity and cost of doing&nbsp;business.</p>
<h2>Sending&nbsp;money</h2>
<p>To send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in
your account should decrease and the amount in another account should
increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this
message will check its authenticity, make the changes, and pass the
message along to other&nbsp;nodes.</p>
<h2>What problems does blockchain&nbsp;solve?</h2>
<p>For a transaction to be accepted and entered into the distributed
ledger, its authenticity needs to be verified. Because the ledger is
distributed, everyone can see everyone else&#8217;s transactions. Therefore
user authentication and transaction authorisation needs to be possible
without compromising a user&#8217;s ability to send secure payments in&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>There is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is
neither physical, printed or representative of anything, how do you
prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply
creating as much new currency as they&nbsp;want?</p>
<p>Another problem is the addition of new transactions to the ledger from
many unrelated users. If each party has their own copy of the ledger,
updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers
completeness and accuracy be assured? How would you update your ledger
to take account of transactions between third parties, and how would you
know the order in which they occurred?<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> The blockchain is remarkable because it is the first technology to solve
all of these problems. Future posts will consider each of these problems
are&nbsp;overcome.</p>
