        <p>Dear S <span class="amp">&amp;</span> S,
Today I woke up thinking about how many good and interesting things have
happened to me because I learnt how to program. Then I thought how good it
would be if you had these benefits&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I guess I should begin by listing some of the benefits before moving onto how
to being to learn, but maybe the value of knowing how to program is clear and 
the first feeling that comes to mind is that you know it would be useful, but you can&#8217;t. Without being too blunt, I believe this is complete bullshit and that anyone who suggests otherwise is your&nbsp;enemy.</p>
<p>It would be a challenge, of course, and any effort you spend is effort you&#8217;re not spending on something else. Write down a list of reasons why you should start and write down some good reasons not to. If you still decide to start after considering why you shouldn&#8217;t, you will likely be much more committed and resilient against the inevitable frustrations and Headaches, which happen to everyone. If you are clear about why you are learning then you will have more&nbsp;success.</p>
<p>So why bother? I think that programming is a kind of magic and you would become
a kind of wizard. As an employee, you would very likely be able to do some
tasks (probably the most interesting tasks) more quickly, and get rid of the boring and repetitive parts. This means you can either slack off whilst still looking good, or get promoted for doing things that are easy for you and leave your boss doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;understand.</p>
<p>If you want to earn more money, you need to create more value, and in my experience some of the easiest ways to create value involve programming. Programming is a force multiplier - you put the effort in once to write a program, and then every time you run it and get the output you are getting the benefit for&nbsp;&#8220;free&#8221;.</p>
<p>How could learning to program help? If you&#8217;re running a coffee shop it might help the boss to know who serves coffee most efficiently, or which products are most popular, or see how many people are in your store each hour of the&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>If you work behind a computer and you regularly do similar tasks then there are even more opportunities. You will already have dveloped your own workflow, and there will be nuances to your work that you know your bosses aren&#8217;t aware of. If you can create a tool to make your life easier&nbsp;then:</p>
<ol>
<li>you&#8217;ve made your life&nbsp;easier</li>
<li>you&#8217;ve done something that only you - with your understanding of the process - could do. This makes you rare and therefore more valuabale and&nbsp;outstanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, its&nbsp;fun.</p>
<h2>How to&nbsp;start</h2>
<p>Its easier than you&nbsp;think.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your applications folder and open an app called&nbsp;&#8220;Terminal&#8221;.</li>
<li>Type <code>python</code> (it&#8217;s already&nbsp;installed)</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it - you&#8217;re ready to strt. You now have all the tools you&nbsp;need. </p>
<p>There are a tonne of ways to learn for free using the internet, and programming
lends itself well to learning-by-google. Infact  I would say that knowing
how to solve a problem by googling it is one of the key things to get confident
at. However the best resource I&#8217;ve found to begin learning python&nbsp;is&#8230;</p>
