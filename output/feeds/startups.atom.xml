What makes this coworking space unique is it&amp;#8217;s conversion from an industrial bakery using shipping containers with glass walls and door&amp;nbsp;sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skylights, glass walls and bright green paint make a great atmosphere, and the space seems popular with designers and founders working in creative industries. It&amp;#8217;s an energetic space with a creative feel to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

I ran around Dublin visiting as many as&amp;nbsp;possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking to rent a hotdesk, which means I don&amp;#8217;t have any storage space at the office and I don&amp;#8217;t have a particular&amp;nbsp;desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are my impressions of eight businesses offering either hot desks or dedicated desks, ranked in order of preference. It&amp;#8217;s subjective. The going rate in Dublin seems to be €200 — €300 per month for a hot desk. Hours range from 9am - 7pm Monday - Friday, to&amp;nbsp;24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First place: &lt;a href="http://dogpatchlabs.com/"&gt;Dogpatch&amp;nbsp;Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogpatch offer a coworking space and access to a community of tech startups. They run regular networking and mentoring events and occupy 3 floors of a warehouse next to an old dock. The offices have a range of interiors styles. The middle level is fairly standard but pleasant open plan offices, the top floor is a flexible working space with event areas. The lower level is a series of vaults that each contain meeting rooms of various sizes. There&amp;#8217;s a lot going on and there&amp;#8217;s a good buzz in the&amp;nbsp;air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of interior spaces is a big plus for me and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to being able to switch up my working environment through the day. There&amp;#8217;s a couple of kitchen areas, and a table football and table-tennis table on the top level. Access is 6am - midnight, and a hot desk is €200 per month. A dedicated desk is&amp;nbsp;€400. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogpatch occupy less than a quarter of the warehouse building, the remainder of the space is used as a shopping mall and a museum. In my opinion Dogpatch is by far the best value and if you&amp;#8217;re working in tech it&amp;#8217;ll probably be your go-to&amp;nbsp;solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second place: &lt;a href="http://studio9.ie/?page_id=223"&gt;Studio9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys are great. The space is a lot smaller that Dogpatch, comprising only ~12 desks. It&amp;#8217;s a basement, but don&amp;#8217;t let that put you off — its open plan and has large windows at either end. The space is well designed and uses a lot of light colours and textures, including wood on the walls and floors. There are also plenty of pot plants. These combine to give a bright and airy atmosphere that feels very natural and&amp;nbsp;bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alcoves down one side of the main room which serve as meeting rooms, and a garden and basic kitchen at the back. The owners want the space to foster a community, and I expect that this is achieved. There are no dedicated offices and no teams using multiple desks, everyone is an independent&amp;nbsp;worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desks are large, and each has its own little wall to provide some privacy. €200 per month ongoing, or €250 for just one month. They offer a trial day for&amp;nbsp;free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Third place: &lt;a href="http://www.officesuites.ie/locations/20-harcourt-street/"&gt;OfficeSuites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building looks well run and appears clean and fresh with adequate resources. The building is an old Georgian tenement with high ceilings, cornicing and lots of natural light. The furnishings and decor lean towards corporate rather than something more interesting, but this works well to add a professional feel to the homely architecture. Access is&amp;nbsp;24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s only two rooms for hotdesking, and most of the building is given to private offices. There&amp;#8217;s a garden with bike storage, meeting rooms and a quiet room for calls. Lockers are extra. They also offer a free day as a&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;€249 p/m for desk access 9am-7pm Monday -&amp;nbsp;Friday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fourth place: &lt;a href="https://www.element78.co/"&gt;Element78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendly and well resourced, but very corporate. The architecture is corporate glass and steel. They&amp;#8217;re situated on the ground floor in a posh business district with large financials for neighbours. It&amp;#8217;s too corporate for me, but if you wanted an impressive place to meet clients and a nice address, this could be it. There were about 15 hot-desks for rent, plus plenty of dedicated desks. Clients seemed to include mostly young tech companies and tech&amp;nbsp;freelancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hoping to find somewhere with more of a community, more inspiring architecture, and more character. I was offered a free day as a&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;€200 for the first month then €350&amp;nbsp;p/m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fifth place: &lt;a href="https://glandore.co/flexible-workspace.aspx#Hot-Desk"&gt;Glandore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glandore offer a relatively luxurious package with a corporate feel. They have a few buildings in Dublin and only the flagship has hotdesking space. There&amp;#8217;s a super looking restaurant and a large club room to relax in, but these are features that I don&amp;#8217;t need, and the rates aren&amp;#8217;t competitive if all you need is a desk and somewhere to take calls. It&amp;#8217;s set up for teams and for impressing clients, and independent tech workers are probably better off&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;€295&amp;nbsp;p/m &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sixth place: &lt;a href="https://www.regus.ie/office-space/ireland/dublin/dublin-4-ballsbridge"&gt;Regus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regus offer a polished on boarding experience and the friendly staff were quick to respond and generally helpful, but the office space was bland, grey and generic. The rooms I visited didn&amp;#8217;t have external windows and it reminded me of the rooms banks often put auditors in. If grey walls and tube lights are your thing then this is for you.  24/7 access, and meeting rooms equipped with&amp;nbsp;A/V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;€299.70&amp;nbsp;p/m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seventh place: &lt;a href="http://www.cocreate.ie/"&gt;CoCreate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited the southern branch and thought the building was a bit shabby and needed a new layer of paint. I recognised the desks as some of the cheapest available from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IKEA&lt;/span&gt;. The rooms were small and needed cleaning, and there was weird art on the&amp;nbsp;wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of paying €200 a month to sit at a small wobbly desk put me off. The place was also almost deserted. Maybe their other branch is better, but this is not for&amp;nbsp;me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;€220&amp;nbsp;p/m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Last place: &lt;a href="http://tcubedublin.com/tcube/index.html"&gt;tCube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last and least, tCube seems to be putting in zero effort. When I visited I saw two rooms that needed painting, disorganised furniture and abandoned bits of computers lying around. The kitchen isn&amp;#8217;t high spec and the meeting room isn&amp;#8217;t big enough. I was also given a speech about how great the wifi was - a prerequisite that was taken for granted everywhere else. At €300 p/m for a dedicated desk its easy to find better value&amp;nbsp;elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Freelance"></category><category term="Coworking"></category><category term="Dublin"></category><category term="Element78"></category><category term="Regus"></category><category term="OfficeSuites"></category><category term="CoCreate"></category><category term="Studio9"></category><category term="Glandore"></category><category term="tCube"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding VC Investment</title><link href="http://johnmathews.eu/investment.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-09T23:03:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-06-09T23:03:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2017-06-09:/investment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How to pitch to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;: Market, Management, Model,&amp;nbsp;Momentum&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; in June and wrote about my experiences &lt;a href="http://johnmathews.eu/articles/lis17.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One of the best sessions was with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;#8220;Understand Investment&amp;#8221;. These are my&amp;nbsp;notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are seeking to identify high-potential startups, and then support and fund&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are looking for something that is innovative and&amp;nbsp;unproven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A startup is not a company but an organisation searching for a business&amp;nbsp;model,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whilst executing and discovering a scalable way to&amp;nbsp;grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups need money for ambitious but credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical stake for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; could be roughly&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s want an exit price of at least 100m, otherwise their business models don&amp;#8217;t work&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10m can seem a lot for a founder with a 30% stake, but it&amp;#8217;s not enough to attract VCs, so aim&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&amp;nbsp;pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify specific people with real&amp;nbsp;needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size of&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your clear competitive advantage - why can no-one else do&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a large and attractive&amp;nbsp;market…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a smart, skilled and cohesive&amp;nbsp;team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a strong ability to deliver quickly and to learn&amp;nbsp;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is ready to go big whatever it&amp;nbsp;takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a unique vision and&amp;nbsp;project-fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuable and differentiated&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient go-to-market and growth&amp;nbsp;channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable monetisation&amp;nbsp;strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability and&amp;nbsp;defensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show traction and that you&amp;#8217;ve cracked the important&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show ambitous and credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a capital-efficient growth&amp;nbsp;model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a clear strategy to scale and&amp;nbsp;win&lt;/li&gt;

Learn to leverage your time, you can never get it back. Being a successful founder is not impossible, it is always&amp;nbsp;exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whilst at the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; I went to a session called &amp;#8220;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve written generally about the summit &lt;a href="http://johnmathews.eu/articles/lis17.md"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oussama spoke with passion and humour. It&amp;#8217;s clear that he cares about encouraging would-be founders and confronting some of the cultural hurdles that exist in Europe. These are my notes from the&amp;nbsp;session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are serious about building something that matters then you have a great and exciting future&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can never predict who will be successful and who will fail. There are a lot of dumb successful people and clever founders can&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really important to learn how to leverage your time effectively. You can lose anything else and get it back but you can never recover the time you&amp;#8217;ve already&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to succeed is to try&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to do something that&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe you need to be more ambitious than average (measured against other countries) because the environment makes it harder to be an entrepreneur. (Attitudes to risk, comfort, security, expectations of failure.. are all unhelpful for&amp;nbsp;founders.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not impossible, just harder. So be more&amp;nbsp;ambitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is replaceable, no-one is&amp;nbsp;unique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can always lose money and replace it. There is so much money in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at Crunchbase and see the failure rate for companies that raised $1m - $10m, it is the same rate for those that raised&amp;nbsp;$10m+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you lose money on a project you will learn things from that experience and you can leverage that&amp;nbsp;learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… But you will never get back the time you&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zombies are companies that make enough money to survive but not enough to provide joy to the people in the company - aim high&amp;nbsp;and…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a company is a big deal, like starting a marriage. Think hard about what you will be doing, what problem you are trying to solve, who you will be working&amp;nbsp;with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe there is not enough money to go around and this makes pitching hard. Silicon Valley doesn&amp;#8217;t have this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average a startup in Europe will raise less than a startup in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe is irrationally concerned about risk. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is less concerned with risk and this is very&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So be pragmatic about&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate in London where the laws are good, even if you don&amp;#8217;t want to operate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. It has a better designed system of corporate law. Estonia is also&amp;nbsp;good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best European city for&amp;nbsp;founders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London, Paris,&amp;nbsp;Berlin..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a best city because none are&amp;nbsp;holistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London has the&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paris has engineering and product development (and no-one outside Paris knows the products&amp;nbsp;exist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin has automation and execution, execution and&amp;nbsp;scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…You need to draw on all 3 of these cities, which when taken together can surpass Silicon&amp;nbsp;Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anecdotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of Slack lives in Vancouver with his wife and kids. He spends 1 day each week in California and everyone thinks Slack is Californian due to good marketing. Forget national pride, be pragmatic. Leverage the&amp;nbsp;internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of Airbnb would fly from New York to California for 1 day each week. They were originally in California where AirBnB started, but decided that if they could make it work in New York then AirBnB would be a success, so they moved to New York and flew back for meetings , etc. If you ask Europeans to come to a meeting in London (which is not as far as California is from New York) people start complaining and deciding they can&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;bothered. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="LIS"></category><category term="Startup"></category><category term="FinTech"></category><category term="Europe"></category></entry><entry><title>The Lisbon Investment Summit</title><link href="http://johnmathews.eu/lis17.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:johnmathews.eu,2017-06-09:/lis17.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Lisbon investment Summit was full of Investors as well as Founders. The sessions were good enough but the real value was in the&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; on June 6 and 7 as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; InsurTech startup team with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jd_sullivan?lang=en-gb"&gt;John Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first startup conference I&amp;#8217;d been to and I arrived hoping to have some useful conversations and understand more about the Fintech and startup spaces in Europe. As usual I wanted to focus on tech, finance and&amp;nbsp;blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who was&amp;nbsp;there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as some outstanding sessions there was a high ratio of investors to startups. This made talking to VCs, bankers and M&amp;amp;A lawyers really easy. I was happy to meet a London-based and Fintech-focussed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; when I sat down to have lunch, and thanks to interrupting a session to ask blockchain related questions on Day 1, a banker struck up a conversation with me over breakfast the next day. I met a lot of people across many relevant roles, and once I&amp;#8217;ve worked through my notes and my new collection of business cards I hope to have some great follow-up&amp;nbsp;meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useful&amp;nbsp;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most useful sessions for me&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmathews.eu/articles/ambitious.md"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thefamily.co"&gt;TheFamily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmathews.eu/articles/investment.md"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Understanding Investment&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.partechventures.com"&gt;Partech&amp;nbsp;Ventures&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Building successful businesses on blockchain technologies&amp;#8221; a panel discussion moderated by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kloaec?lang=en"&gt;Kevin Loaec&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="http://chainsmiths.com/"&gt;Chainsmiths&lt;/a&gt; blockchain consultancy, and including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mir_btc"&gt;Mir Serena Liponi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.blockchainlab.it/"&gt;Blockchain&amp;nbsp;Lab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain session was valuable because it&amp;#8217;s unusual to meet people who have been working in the blockchain space for several years. I&amp;#8217;m always wary of being distracted by the hype and noise around developments in the blockchain space so I appreciated hearing some informed and level-headed&amp;nbsp;opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political&amp;nbsp;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening session included a speech from the Mayor of Lisbon and the next day opened with a speech from the Secretary of Industry. Both speeches conveyed an open and progressive attitude to international cooperation aimed at promoting and supporting founders and startups in Portugal. The warm words were supported by practical measures including tax incentives and a state-backed scheme to match amounts contributed by private investors. It was really refreshing to hear a politician extol the virtues of multinational cooperation and bringing different cultures into Portugal. I wish Britain could do this&amp;nbsp;too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Brexit, which inevitably arose due to London&amp;#8217;s present role as a centre of finance and innovation, it seems Europe is still expecting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; to come to its senses, and cannot understand why it&amp;#8217;s destroying its goodwill and reputation so&amp;nbsp;thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two days in Lisbon were full of useful and energetic conversations and it was a great experience pitching &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; multiple times and talking about what we&amp;#8217;re trying to do and how blockchains are a part of that. The opportunities to meet founders and investors are invaluable for making informed decisions. Lisbon is a beautiful city which I found easy to get around and always felt safe in. It&amp;#8217;s also refreshingly &lt;a href="http://johnmathews.eu/articles/london.md"&gt;affordable!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
