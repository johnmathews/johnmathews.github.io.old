&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that I am much happier as a Christian than I would be if I
weren’t. By “being a Christian” I mean following Jesus - trying my best to act,
think and speak like he want’s me to because I’m grateful that he did what I
believe he did. I believe he died for my sins and is now alive, having been
miraculously resurrected by his father&lt;sup id="sf-why-even-start-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-why-even-start-1" class="simple-footnote" title="And many other things also."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
(who is now my father too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just an intellectual exercise. I believe that Jesus is alive because I
seem to have experienced his companionship and intervention in my day-to-day
life. This is unusual, mind boggling, and makes things significantly more
complicated than if I thought he were dead. Nonetheless it seems to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like I see supernatural intervention every day or anything, but there
have been various times - too many to discard - when my prayers have been
answered in practical ways (I’ll leave out the abstract for now) that have
surprised me and given me a lot of respect for the risen Jesus doing what its
said he’d do in the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="some-examples-of-when-my-prayers-have-been-answered"&gt;Some examples of when my prayers have been answered:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was this time I was in Yemen trying to get back to my room across town,
at night and during a storm. I was lost and couldn’t read Arabic to understand
which bus to get. So I prayed, and two buses later I got off at the right stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example, I was getting a haircut in Liverpool Street Station in London,
and as I was sitting in the chair someone took my backpack. When I came to pay,
I realised my laptop and wallet had gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up all hope of finding it again, despite wondering around the alleys and
parks looking for it for a few hours. My parents-in-law prayed about it and
were really confident it would come back to me, which seemed super unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later I received a call from an office worker in the Gherkin
building - my bag was under his desk and he wanted to know
if I’d like to collect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example I tend to remember happened not long after I’d first moved to
Vienna. I was feeling very, very lonely and isolated and I was wondering how on
earth I was going to find some sort of normal that was healthy and sustainable.
Try as I might, I wasn’t enjoying things at all and was feeling stressed and
overwhelmed. I remember walking up this steep hill in the 18th district towards
my office, and repeatedly praying this really simple prayer ‘God, please help,
please help, please help..’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing dramatic happened that day, or even that week as far as I can remember.
But when I look back, it was a turning point when things started getting better
instead of worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can call this last example an intangible answer to prayer. Maybe
it is, but I think anyone whose grappled with overwhelming loneliness or panic
would say that the emotions become all too tangible at times. Being in a
different emotional state seemed to make a tangible difference to just about
every area of life. Eating, productivity at work, relationships with friends
and colleagues, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only the beginning of why I think Jesus is alive and why I think
Christianity is a real and living faith. It’s not just a tradition, a worldview
or a set of rules and ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Christianity is a relationship with Jesus. He did lots of amazing
things that have let me have a very practical relationship with him. It’s an
almost unbelievable premise from which to live a life, with so many
implications, but it holds up to scrutiny and my experiences bear it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-am-i-writing-this"&gt;Why am I writing this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Jesus’ incredible works and their implications, modern Christianity
seems to be in a really confused and ineffective state. Ideas and thoughts
about Christianity-the-faith have become mixed up with cultural christianity,
or christian politics and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are each different things, and unless we distinguish between them with
the words we use, we are going to find it hard to think clearly and harder to
communicate effectively. I have a suspicion that we are in a negative cycle of
imprecise thinking leading to imprecise articulation, which leads to further
imprecise thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless we can talk and think about one thing at a time, atomically if
necessary, we take on additional risk of reaching the wrong conclusions
personally, and  arguing with others due to misunderstanding rather than actual disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should strive for a rich and precise vocabulary to navigate our Christian
lives, and aspire to think clearly about experiences and questions we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imprecise thinking is frustrating, and conversation is less enjoyable when
there’s an increased risk of disagreement, or misunderstanding what the other
parties mean. This makes it harder to talk about our faith, which makes talking
less common. This creates room for misunderstanding and apathy, and lost
opportunities, and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-why-even-start-1"&gt;And many other things also. &lt;a href="#sf-why-even-start-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content><category term="Non-technical/Christianity"></category></entry></feed>
