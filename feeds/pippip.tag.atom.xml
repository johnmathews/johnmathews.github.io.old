&lt;p&gt;It would be great if the writing and sending of important messages could be
separated, so that I could write something long before I needed to send it, and
know that then sending would happen at the right time without having to think

birthday, or to my wife on our 10th anniversary. I also designed a check-in
mechanism, so that messages could be sent if I disappeared or pass&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://PipPip.email"&gt;PipPip&lt;/a&gt; is the result - event-driven and scheduled email delivery, from days to&amp;nbsp;decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re working on validating the idea and finding the right niche&amp;nbsp;audience. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="PipPip"></category></entry></feed>
