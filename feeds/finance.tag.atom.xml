&lt;p&gt;Next week I begin working with &lt;a href="http://bitnation.co"&gt;Bitnation&lt;/a&gt; as their finance officer. I&amp;#8217;m excited about this because I get to work on a really ambitious project using new technology to do something innovative and&amp;nbsp;valuable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bitnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitnation&amp;#8217;s purpose is to offer the same services as governments do, in a way that delivers more benefit to&amp;nbsp;users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West this may not immediately sound like a big deal. Our governments are fairly organised and the services are usually &amp;#8220;good enough&amp;#8221;. Most significantly, we are not used to thinking about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; services (passports, visa, drivers licences) or registration services (land registry, marriage certificates) as a service that we are customers of - like our internet service provider, or our electricity&amp;nbsp;supplier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the world dysfunctional or unjust governments represent a huge obstacle to improving everyday life, the progress and achievement that many people can hope to realise is limited because of&amp;nbsp;this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was a viable alternative to a passport from a jurisdiction renowned for forgery, or a credit rating that acknowledged your land holdings despited your governments inability to maintain a credible database, then you could begin to travel, trade and enjoy the benefits that citizens of many western states take for&amp;nbsp;granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m excited that I get to use my skills in an innovative tech company that is aiming to do something really&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services include secure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; systems, asset registry and dispute resolution. Identification (in particular) is an area full of problems, and blockchain tech could offer some really significant improvements. Bitnation wants to create a platform where voluntary nations can be created and administered, and where people can choose what jurisdictional system they are part of. If this is widely implemented it will be&amp;nbsp;unprecedented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurisdictions would offer their own services according to their own principles, and because they are easy to create and membership is voluntarily, jurisdictions would compete to attract citizens. This should lead to improvements for the users of each service, and is intended to provide an alternative to the slow, expensive and opaque processing methods commonly associated with services from geographically defined&amp;nbsp;nationstates. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Bitnation"></category><category term="Blockchain"></category><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Identity"></category><category term="Consulting"></category><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>Introduction to the Æternity blockchain project</title><link href="aeternity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-05T21:04:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-05T21:04:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-05-05:aeternity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Æternity is a new blockchain project aiming to facilitate large volumes of smart-contracts which can interface with external data sources. This is accomplished using a decentralised oracle based on prediction&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are my notes on the æternity blockchain project, I&amp;#8217;m not affiliated with the æternity&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Æternity is a new blockchain project that is pre-launch. The headline goal is to securely facilitate large volumes of smart-contracts which interface with external data sources. This is made possible via a decentralised oracle based on prediction markets. These terms are explained below. The æternity project has proposed several notable technical&amp;nbsp;features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Contracts in&amp;nbsp;state-channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracles and native prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance by prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different types of&amp;nbsp;node &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Contracts in&amp;nbsp;state-channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart contract is a way to execute a contract without an intermediary (middle-man) and without&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart contract is a protocol which is stored and executed on a blockchain, executing transactions (outputs) based on specific inputs and programmable logic automatically. The logic often mirrors that contained in clauses of a written&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State channels are payment networks that exchange funds off-chain and periodically settle up accounts with the main blockchain. (The Bitcoin Lightning Network is creating a system for routing Bitcoin payments through state&amp;nbsp;channels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State channels increase scalability by making groups of transactions independent of each other. This allows them to be processed in&amp;nbsp;parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;æternity proposes executing smart-contracts in Turing-complete state channels (Turing complete means, colloquially, real-world and general purpose), which should allow greater volumes of transactions, and make the smart contracts more secure and easier to&amp;nbsp;analyse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because executing the smart-contracts off-chain makes them private and the code used to execute the smart contract won’t need to be broadcast to the primary blockchain. This should increase processing capacity by allowing contracts to execute in&amp;nbsp;parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages to the state-channel approach include reduced transparency, as running smart contracts in state channels requires more trust in both the contract creator and the node running&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracles and prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Oracle functionality allows smart-contracts to interact with data outside the æternity blockchain. This is possible by checking on-chain prediction market results and rewarding users who made the correct prediction. Users are rewarded through automated payments and the immediate recording of transactions in the blockchain. This creates incentives to participate in prediction markets, which have  been shown to be&amp;nbsp;effective. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-chain, rather than off-chain allows greater efficiency and&amp;nbsp;integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prediction market is expected to run using a native (on-chain) consensus procedure. The oracle mechanism is designed to use the same consensus&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Governance by prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle functionality compliments prediction market&amp;nbsp;functionality. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prediction markets are proposed to implement governance of the æternity blockchain. This is a new&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The æternity protocol would be governed by user input. A prediction market will exist where changes to features and protocols would result in a higher token&amp;nbsp;value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incentive to increase the value of a token (Æon) would allow the æternity community to decide efficiently which changes to&amp;nbsp;implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low level protocol changes to variables like block times and block capacity could be&amp;nbsp;possible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consensus developed by the prediction market will initially provide input to the development team’s&amp;nbsp;decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, a fully autonomous prediction market for governance is expected (a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAO&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; is normally used for large-scale systems that manage the allocation of scarce network resources (telecoms, banking, instant&amp;nbsp;messaging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could make it easier to run a lightning network and process many state-channels in&amp;nbsp;parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, ÆTernity is the first blockchain project to be written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different types of&amp;nbsp;node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The æternity network will contain nodes with different functions. Each type of node will contribute towards the efficient functioning of particular aspects of the&amp;nbsp;network &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node types will&amp;nbsp;include &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity - Lots of channels and lots of users. Open a channel to issue a contract, for a&amp;nbsp;fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges - Trustless exchanges of assets offered by market makers. Profitable to market makers because of transaction&amp;nbsp;fees.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presumably features such as consensus algorithms and prediction markets will also require their own dedicated node types. Users of the node will incur transaction fees to participate, providing an incentive to run a&amp;nbsp;node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows a greater transaction volume, removing scalability problems that Bitcoin and Ethereum have&amp;nbsp;experienced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding works by splitting the space of possible accounts into subspaces (for example based on the first digit of a numerical&amp;nbsp;address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each shard gets a set of validators. Each validator validates 1 shard&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts and transactions within the same shard work as&amp;nbsp;normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts and transactions across shards require alternative techniques based on &amp;#8220;transaction&amp;nbsp;receipts&amp;#8221; &lt;/li&gt;

I tried several exchanges and chose the quickest, cheapest conversion&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On April 3rd, I happened to be Googling digital currencies and blockchain innovations when I came across the &lt;a href="http://www.Æternity.com"&gt;Æternity website&lt;/a&gt; and skimmed their &lt;a href="https://blockchain.Æternity.com/%C3%A6ternity-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;. The project is ambitious, like many crypto projects, but seems well organised. The team is well known in the space. There is a clear plan to develop the project and create a blockchain technology that, if successful, could bring. A step change in the use of digital currencies for high volume low value transactions, and the viable implementation of smart&amp;nbsp;contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I realised that phase 1 of the Initial Coin Offering (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;) was about to begin, and if I wanted I could acquire the rights to Æons (the Æternity token). During phase 1, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; would purchase 1100 Æons. In early April 2017, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; was worth about&amp;nbsp;£38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was willing to make a small and risky investment, but in order to do that I would need to work out how to convert my conventional Sterling into Bitcoin or Ether, in order to then purchase Æons. The Æternity website made it super easy to set up an Etherium wallet, and to use that wallet to invest in the Æternity project, but buying Ether immediately and putting it in my new wallet proved to be&amp;nbsp;challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpfully, the Æternity project had partnered with the Swiss firm &amp;#8216;Bitcoin Suisse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; who would directly convert to Æons from fiat currencies, cutting out the need to purchase an intermediate digital currency. However once I&amp;#8217;d completed the identity checks and signed, scanned and sent the multiple forms, I realised I&amp;#8217;d need to pay a &amp;#8216;signing on&amp;#8217; fee of about £70. To Bitcoin Suisse&amp;#8217; credit though, they did manually approve my identification and contract within an&amp;nbsp;hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought the project would still be a good investment even with this extra cost, but I determined to exhaust all other possibilities first. I&amp;#8217;m familiar with cryptocurrency wallets and public/private keys due to some &lt;a href="encryption.html"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to immediately begin trying to set up an account with an&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was a fairly chaotic few hours where I would sign-up to several exchanges and see how close I could get to purchasing either Bitcoin or Ether immediately, before realising I either had to wait 48 hours for security clearances, or provide additional details, or wait for manual verification of my scanned identity&amp;nbsp;documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening I had a rough idea of which usernames, passwords and (small) sterling amounts had been submitted to each&amp;nbsp;exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of false starts, I used a combination of the &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; desktop website and their iOS app to purchase &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; up to their weekly limit, and then used multiple cards to increase my holding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;. The Coinbase app would bug out when processing a debit card payment and verifying the card details with the bank. This had initially led me to try other exchanges, where I would hit other roadblocks and delays. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;, for example, doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to make trades in the first 48 hours (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIRC&lt;/span&gt;) after registering, which is reasonable enough unless you&amp;#8217;re in a&amp;nbsp;hurry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had a few Ether to my name, the rest of the process was simple. I was delighted to visit &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/"&gt;Etherscan.io&lt;/a&gt; and view the details of my Etherium - Æternity transactions almost immediately. This gave me a lot of confidence that I hadn&amp;#8217;t sent money into a void, and was a nice contrast to my (successful) experience buying bitcoin in early&amp;nbsp;2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the simple tool to check your Æ balance at the bottom of Eternity&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://wallet.Æternity.com"&gt;contribution page&lt;/a&gt; assured me that I&amp;#8217;d made my investment successfully. To me, the Æternity project stands as an exciting endeavor seeking to solve some widespread and highly valuable technical challenges, I hope they&amp;#8217;re successful and wish them&amp;nbsp;well.    &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Fintech"></category><category term="Finance"></category><category term="Digital Currencies"></category><category term="Blockchains"></category><category term="DLT"></category><category term="Æternity"></category><category term="ICO"></category></entry><entry><title>Digital currencies: the basics</title><link href="digital-currencies-the-basics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-19T21:02:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-08-19T21:02:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-08-19:digital-currencies-the-basics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Digital currencies are often discussed in the context of finance, technology and economics.

The Blockchain - the technology which applications like Bitcoin are built on - is significant because it removes the need for trust or an intermediary between unrelated parties transacting with each other. So far, the most influential and famous digital currency is&amp;nbsp;Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to introduce the basic concepts of digital currencies and the problems a distributed ledger system needs to&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a digital&amp;nbsp;currency?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital currency is an internet based medium of exchange. Units of digital currency are not printed, are not physical, and represent nothing. A unit of currency is produced by running algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a unit of currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin) is&amp;nbsp;generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If the currency represents nothing, why is it&amp;nbsp;valuable?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people believe that in future, other people will believe it does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies) which also don&amp;#8217;t represent anything physical. (Although these examples are  supported by laws or&amp;nbsp;regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, creating a new currency without the support of government hasn&amp;#8217;t been practical&amp;nbsp;because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new currency (otherwise people would create counterfeit currency, decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards&amp;nbsp;zero)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An intermediary (a bank) was required for all large or remote transactions, to make sure that the amount of money each party owns is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventing double spending of&amp;nbsp;funds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technological breakthrough was preventing double spending without requiring an intermediary. This is made possible by using cryptographic techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful computers which have only recently become&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central and distributed&amp;nbsp;ledgers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conventional currencies everyone&amp;#8217;s balance and transactions are recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much money each account has) and each account holder only has access to their own balance and transactions. With digital currencies, a copy of the entire ledger (every transaction ever made by everyone) is held on each computer (or node), and anyone can see everyone&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, if two parties wish to make a remote transaction then they need a bank to be the intermediary. The bank mediates by updating the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds as a result of the transaction. This is how one party knows if the counter-party is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must be involved in every transaction between its account holders. This need for an intermediary increases the complexity and cost of doing&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sending&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in your account should decrease and the amount in another account should increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this message will check its authenticity, make the changes, and pass the message along to other&amp;nbsp;nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What problems does blockchain&amp;nbsp;solve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a transaction to be accepted and entered into the distributed ledger, its authenticity needs to be verified. Because the ledger is distributed, everyone can see everyone else&amp;#8217;s transactions. Therefore user authentication and transaction authorisation needs to be possible without compromising a user&amp;#8217;s ability to send secure payments in&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is neither physical, printed or representative of anything, how do you prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply creating as much new currency as they&amp;nbsp;want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the addition of new transactions to the ledger from many unrelated users. If each party has their own copy of the ledger, updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers completeness and accuracy be assured? How would you update your ledger to take account of transactions between third parties, and how would you know the order in which they occurred?&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The blockchain is remarkable because it is the first technology to solve all of these problems. Future posts will consider each of these problems are&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Byzantine Generals problem, which is nicely described in the introduction of 
&lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
