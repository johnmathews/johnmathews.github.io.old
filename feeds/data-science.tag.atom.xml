scientist. I was confident I already had the mathematical and analysis
skills I needed, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t familiar with the tools of the&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some googling brought me to Coursera, and the &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science"&gt;Data Science
Specialisation&lt;/a&gt;
run by Johns Hopkins University.  It consists of 9 courses, and so far
I&amp;#8217;ve completed five. If you do the courses in order then prior knowledge
isn&amp;#8217;t required, and I think the courses strike a good balance of brevity
and&amp;nbsp;depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main downside to me is that the courses exclusively use R (which is
popular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more
popular in&amp;nbsp;Industry).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data
science, such as statistical inference or machine learning. Key concepts
and tools in each subject are explained and developed, and whilst it&amp;#8217;s
not as thorough as a longer course would be, there is more than enough
material packed into the lectures, quizzes, assignments and projects to
apply to real&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve read that the second half of the specialisation is a lot more
technical than the first, so I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to setting aside some
time, working through the assignments and acquiring some useful&amp;nbsp;skills!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="Coursera"></category><category term="Data Science"></category><category term="R"></category></entry></feed>
