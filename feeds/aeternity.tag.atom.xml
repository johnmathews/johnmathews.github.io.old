&lt;p&gt;Æternity is a new blockchain project that is pre-launch. The headline goal is to securely facilitate large volumes of smart-contracts which interface with external data sources. This is made possible via a decentralised oracle based on prediction markets. These terms are explained below. The æternity project has proposed several notable technical&amp;nbsp;features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Contracts in&amp;nbsp;state-channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracles and native prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance by prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different types of&amp;nbsp;node &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Contracts in&amp;nbsp;state-channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart contract is a way to execute a contract without an intermediary (middle-man) and without&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart contract is a protocol which is stored and executed on a blockchain, executing transactions (outputs) based on specific inputs and programmable logic automatically. The logic often mirrors that contained in clauses of a written&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State channels are payment networks that exchange funds off-chain and periodically settle up accounts with the main blockchain. (The Bitcoin Lightning Network is creating a system for routing Bitcoin payments through state&amp;nbsp;channels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State channels increase scalability by making groups of transactions independent of each other. This allows them to be processed in&amp;nbsp;parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;æternity proposes executing smart-contracts in Turing-complete state channels (Turing complete means, colloquially, real-world and general purpose), which should allow greater volumes of transactions, and make the smart contracts more secure and easier to&amp;nbsp;analyse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because executing the smart-contracts off-chain makes them private and the code used to execute the smart contract won’t need to be broadcast to the primary blockchain. This should increase processing capacity by allowing contracts to execute in&amp;nbsp;parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages to the state-channel approach include reduced transparency, as running smart contracts in state channels requires more trust in both the contract creator and the node running&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracles and prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Oracle functionality allows smart-contracts to interact with data outside the æternity blockchain. This is possible by checking on-chain prediction market results and rewarding users who made the correct prediction. Users are rewarded through automated payments and the immediate recording of transactions in the blockchain. This creates incentives to participate in prediction markets, which have  been shown to be&amp;nbsp;effective. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-chain, rather than off-chain allows greater efficiency and&amp;nbsp;integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prediction market is expected to run using a native (on-chain) consensus procedure. The oracle mechanism is designed to use the same consensus&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Governance by prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle functionality compliments prediction market&amp;nbsp;functionality. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prediction markets are proposed to implement governance of the æternity blockchain. This is a new&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The æternity protocol would be governed by user input. A prediction market will exist where changes to features and protocols would result in a higher token&amp;nbsp;value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incentive to increase the value of a token (Æon) would allow the æternity community to decide efficiently which changes to&amp;nbsp;implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low level protocol changes to variables like block times and block capacity could be&amp;nbsp;possible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consensus developed by the prediction market will initially provide input to the development team’s&amp;nbsp;decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, a fully autonomous prediction market for governance is expected (a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAO&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; is normally used for large-scale systems that manage the allocation of scarce network resources (telecoms, banking, instant&amp;nbsp;messaging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could make it easier to run a lightning network and process many state-channels in&amp;nbsp;parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, ÆTernity is the first blockchain project to be written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different types of&amp;nbsp;node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The æternity network will contain nodes with different functions. Each type of node will contribute towards the efficient functioning of particular aspects of the&amp;nbsp;network &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node types will&amp;nbsp;include &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity - Lots of channels and lots of users. Open a channel to issue a contract, for a&amp;nbsp;fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges - Trustless exchanges of assets offered by market makers. Profitable to market makers because of transaction&amp;nbsp;fees.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presumably features such as consensus algorithms and prediction markets will also require their own dedicated node types. Users of the node will incur transaction fees to participate, providing an incentive to run a&amp;nbsp;node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows a greater transaction volume, removing scalability problems that Bitcoin and Ethereum have&amp;nbsp;experienced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding works by splitting the space of possible accounts into subspaces (for example based on the first digit of a numerical&amp;nbsp;address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each shard gets a set of validators. Each validator validates 1 shard&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts and transactions within the same shard work as&amp;nbsp;normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts and transactions across shards require alternative techniques based on &amp;#8220;transaction&amp;nbsp;receipts&amp;#8221; &lt;/li&gt;

I tried several exchanges and chose the quickest, cheapest conversion&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On April 3rd, I happened to be Googling digital currencies and blockchain innovations when I came across the &lt;a href="http://www.Æternity.com"&gt;Æternity website&lt;/a&gt; and skimmed their &lt;a href="https://blockchain.Æternity.com/%C3%A6ternity-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;. The project is ambitious, like many crypto projects, but seems well organised. The team is well known in the space. There is a clear plan to develop the project and create a blockchain technology that, if successful, could bring. A step change in the use of digital currencies for high volume low value transactions, and the viable implementation of smart&amp;nbsp;contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I realised that phase 1 of the Initial Coin Offering (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;) was about to begin, and if I wanted I could acquire the rights to Æons (the Æternity token). During phase 1, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; would purchase 1100 Æons. In early April 2017, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; was worth about&amp;nbsp;£38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was willing to make a small and risky investment, but in order to do that I would need to work out how to convert my conventional Sterling into Bitcoin or Ether, in order to then purchase Æons. The Æternity website made it super easy to set up an Etherium wallet, and to use that wallet to invest in the Æternity project, but buying Ether immediately and putting it in my new wallet proved to be&amp;nbsp;challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpfully, the Æternity project had partnered with the Swiss firm &amp;#8216;Bitcoin Suisse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; who would directly convert to Æons from fiat currencies, cutting out the need to purchase an intermediate digital currency. However once I&amp;#8217;d completed the identity checks and signed, scanned and sent the multiple forms, I realised I&amp;#8217;d need to pay a &amp;#8216;signing on&amp;#8217; fee of about £70. To Bitcoin Suisse&amp;#8217; credit though, they did manually approve my identification and contract within an&amp;nbsp;hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought the project would still be a good investment even with this extra cost, but I determined to exhaust all other possibilities first. I&amp;#8217;m familiar with cryptocurrency wallets and public/private keys due to some &lt;a href="encryption.html"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to immediately begin trying to set up an account with an&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was a fairly chaotic few hours where I would sign-up to several exchanges and see how close I could get to purchasing either Bitcoin or Ether immediately, before realising I either had to wait 48 hours for security clearances, or provide additional details, or wait for manual verification of my scanned identity&amp;nbsp;documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening I had a rough idea of which usernames, passwords and (small) sterling amounts had been submitted to each&amp;nbsp;exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of false starts, I used a combination of the &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; desktop website and their iOS app to purchase &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; up to their weekly limit, and then used multiple cards to increase my holding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;. The Coinbase app would bug out when processing a debit card payment and verifying the card details with the bank. This had initially led me to try other exchanges, where I would hit other roadblocks and delays. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;, for example, doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to make trades in the first 48 hours (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIRC&lt;/span&gt;) after registering, which is reasonable enough unless you&amp;#8217;re in a&amp;nbsp;hurry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had a few Ether to my name, the rest of the process was simple. I was delighted to visit &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/"&gt;Etherscan.io&lt;/a&gt; and view the details of my Etherium - Æternity transactions almost immediately. This gave me a lot of confidence that I hadn&amp;#8217;t sent money into a void, and was a nice contrast to my (successful) experience buying bitcoin in early&amp;nbsp;2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the simple tool to check your Æ balance at the bottom of Eternity&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://wallet.Æternity.com"&gt;contribution page&lt;/a&gt; assured me that I&amp;#8217;d made my investment successfully. To me, the Æternity project stands as an exciting endeavor seeking to solve some widespread and highly valuable technical challenges, I hope they&amp;#8217;re successful and wish them&amp;nbsp;well.    &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Fintech"></category><category term="Finance"></category><category term="Digital Currencies"></category><category term="Blockchains"></category><category term="DLT"></category><category term="Æternity"></category><category term="ICO"></category></entry></feed>
