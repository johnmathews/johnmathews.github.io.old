&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1: Why is product-led growth of rising&amp;nbsp;importance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;) strategy that relies on using
   your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product-Led Growth (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt;) means that every team influences the product:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing - how can our products generate a demand&amp;nbsp;fly-wheel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales - how can we use the product to qualify our prospects for&amp;nbsp;us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Success - how can we create a product that helps customers become
  successful beyond our&amp;nbsp;dreams?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having every team focussed on the product, you create a culture that is
   built around enduring customer&amp;nbsp;value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By leading with the product throughout the org, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; companies get&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shorter sales&amp;nbsp;cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower Customer Acquisition Costs&amp;nbsp;(CACs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher Revenue Per Employee (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPE&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy is an action plan that specifies how a company will reach
   target customers and achieve a competitive&amp;nbsp;advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to select a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;, you first need to understand:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market&amp;nbsp;conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;competitive&amp;nbsp;positioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ideal&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;product&amp;nbsp;offering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing these elements will help you choose the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; that will
   acquire, retain and grow you customer base in the most capital-efficient&amp;nbsp;way &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sales-Led Go-To-Market&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Centers: Sales, Marketing, Customer&amp;nbsp;Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost Centers: Engineering,&amp;nbsp;Product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual Contract Value (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACV&lt;/span&gt;) can be very&amp;nbsp;high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise first solutions that are very complex and therefore need a
high-touch sales&amp;nbsp;model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Total Addressable Market (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt;) is very small, because your market
is super niche, you can quite easily talk to almost all market
participants. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; is built for large&amp;nbsp;TAMs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s great for new categories of product where education is required,
because you need to change how people approach a problem. This takes time
and requires education.
This is turn requires that you understand your customers pain points,
objections, core problems. If you jump to quickly a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy then
you risk a high church rate because you haven&amp;#8217;t understood or educated
your customers well&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales cycles are very&amp;nbsp;long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Life Time Value (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTV&lt;/span&gt;) must be high enough to recoup the investment in
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;. This often requires charging the customer a premium. This premium
  price isn&amp;#8217;t because the product is amazing, or more valuable to the
  customer, but because the customer acquisition model is more&amp;nbsp;expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a Sales-Led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;, you need to watch out for competitors who can
  sell more efficiently, or have a more efficient Customer Acquisition
  Model. They can steal your market share by offering the same product with
  at a lower&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Acquisition methods are super leaky. Most marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) never result in a closed deal, this is partly because:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it encourages markets to gate content in order to hit their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MQL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;goals    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it focusses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent.
  (but reading a white-paper or brochure doesn&amp;#8217;t mean im going to buy
  the&amp;nbsp;thing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the entire process rewards creating friction in the buying&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, there is often a disconnect between marketing and&amp;nbsp;sales &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Product-Led Go-To-Market&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching from Sales-Led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; to Product-Led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; creates a defensive&amp;nbsp;moat &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product led marketing team asks &amp;#8220;How can we use the product to qualify our
prospects for&amp;nbsp;us?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product led customer success team asks &amp;#8220;How can we create a product that
  helps customers be successful without our&amp;nbsp;help?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product-led engineering team asks &amp;#8220;How can we create a product with a quick&amp;nbsp;time-to-value?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth is much faster, because:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need fewer resources to&amp;nbsp;scale, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the top of the customer funnel is much&amp;nbsp;wider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt; is much&amp;nbsp;lower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPE&lt;/span&gt; (revenue per&amp;nbsp;employee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience is&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 - Free, Freemium or&amp;nbsp;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOAT&lt;/span&gt; framework to pick the right &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;arket Strategy - Dominant? Disruptive?&amp;nbsp;Differentiated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;cean Conditions - Blue or&amp;nbsp;Red?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;udience - Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing&amp;nbsp;strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime to Value - How much time do you need for a customer to
  experience the&amp;nbsp;value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant - Do it better than the competition &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; charge a lower&amp;nbsp;price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt; big&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at lower
cost than anyone else on the&amp;nbsp;market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the user realize significant ongoing value quickly with little or no&amp;nbsp;help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to be the undisputed market&amp;nbsp;leader?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiated - Pick and win a fight against an industry giant &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main line of defense against the giant is&amp;nbsp;specialization &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on an underserved&amp;nbsp;niche&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a specific job better than the competition but charge significantly&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not a one-size-fits-all&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free trials and demos work well&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because its specialized, combining freemium with quick time-to-value is&amp;nbsp;difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main competitive advantage is how you solve your customers&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your market have underserved&amp;nbsp;customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt; big&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACV&lt;/span&gt; high&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could prospects experience a Magic Moment during a free&amp;nbsp;trial?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disruptive - Charge less for an inferior product (e.g. Canva, Google docs)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a simpler product that solves a specific pain point, and because
  its simpler, its faster, you can charge less, and its more appropriate to
  some over-served or priced-out&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a scaled-down&amp;nbsp;product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs must be&amp;nbsp;low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product must be easy to&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAM&lt;/span&gt; large&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can on-boarding be completely&amp;nbsp;self-service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freemium model&amp;nbsp;thrives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3 - Red-Ocean or Blue-Ocean&amp;nbsp;markets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-ocean companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a larger
share of the existing market. As the market gets crowded, opportunity for
profit and growth reduces. Products become commodities. Cut-throat competition
turns the waters&amp;nbsp;red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue-ocean companies access untapped market space and create demand. They have
opportunity for highly profitable growth. Competition is irrelevant. Create and
capture new&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some markets will be red-ocean, but a particular niche within it will be blue&amp;nbsp;ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Oceans require educating the customer to create the demand. This is
high-touch, and often a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy isn&amp;#8217;t going to work. It needs to be
sales-led in order to educate the customer enough. But if Time-To-Value (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTV&lt;/span&gt;)
is short then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; could be&amp;nbsp;great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Oceans need big wide funnels in order to compete, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategies
work great. They&amp;#8217;re defensible, keep costs low and make sales cycles&amp;nbsp;short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4 - Top-Down or Bottom-Up selling&amp;nbsp;strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLG&lt;/span&gt; works for&amp;nbsp;bottom-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High touch sales-led strategies work for Top-Down enterprise sales strategies, where the product is super complex and the sales cyccle is very&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-Down (Sales team is the growth&amp;nbsp;engine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower customer&amp;nbsp;churn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor revenue&amp;nbsp;distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long sales&amp;nbsp;cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Trial sometimes&amp;nbsp;works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom-Up (Product is the growth&amp;nbsp;engine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wider&amp;nbsp;top-of-funnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictable sales&amp;nbsp;figures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue&amp;nbsp;diversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable&amp;nbsp;fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small contracts&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-paying&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expertise&amp;nbsp;shortage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upfront investment as non-paying customers drain&amp;nbsp;resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freemium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free-Trial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5 -&amp;nbsp;Time-to-Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time until you deliver on your promise to&amp;nbsp;prospects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time until the product sells&amp;nbsp;itself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategies require fast&amp;nbsp;time-to-value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rank your uses across 2 dimensions and group into 4 quadrants. The
   dimensions are Ability (low - high) and Motivation (low - high)&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Motivation - Low Ability = Mission&amp;nbsp;Impossible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Motivation - Low Ability =&amp;nbsp;Rookie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Motivation - High Ability =&amp;nbsp;Veteran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Motivation - High Ability =&amp;nbsp;Spoiled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out your top two quadrants. Unless all your users are Spoiled, you
   need to decrease&amp;nbsp;Time-To-Value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How motivated are your&amp;nbsp;users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your product easy for your target audience to&amp;nbsp;use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can users experience the core value (magic moment?) without&amp;nbsp;hand-holding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 2 - Build Your&amp;nbsp;Foundation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 7 - Build a product-led&amp;nbsp;foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positive feedback loop:
1. &lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt; your value
2. &lt;strong&gt;Communicate&lt;/strong&gt; it
3. &lt;strong&gt;Deliver&lt;/strong&gt; on your promise
4.&amp;nbsp;Repeat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 8 - Understand your&amp;nbsp;value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re selling live-chat software, you&amp;#8217;re not really selling live-chat
software, you are selling a new and better way to acquire&amp;nbsp;customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are selling the outcome, the result, the&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain makes us want to change so that we can avoid or prevent the pain&amp;nbsp;altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is product&amp;nbsp;agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why people buy a&amp;nbsp;product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional Outcome - the core task that needs to get&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Outcome - how a customer wants to feel or avoid feeling as a
result of the functional&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Outcome - how a customer wants to be perceived by others by using
   your&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every software, there are usage patterns that point towards to core outcomes
that are most important to&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest differences between sales-led and product-led companies is
that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SL&lt;/span&gt; companies monitor usage patters to see if users are accomplishing
meaningful outcomes. These outcomes are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;value-metrics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A value-metric is the way you measure value exchange in your product&lt;/strong&gt;. They
are the linchpin to successful execution of a product-led &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTM&lt;/span&gt; strategy because
you are aligning your revenue model directly with your customer acquisition
model. Because your value metrics play a vital role in how you price your
product, set up your monitoring, and build your&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value metrics could&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for vimeo, number of videos uploaded by the&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for slack, number of messages sent by the&amp;nbsp;user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for paypal, amount of revenue generated by the user&amp;nbsp;(processed?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;functional&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;outcome based&lt;/strong&gt; value metrics. Functional value
metrics are &amp;#8220;per user&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;per 100 videos&amp;#8221;. Pricing scales around functions of
usage. Outcome based value metrics charge based on the outcome, e.g. how many
views a video received, or how much money a customer made when using your
payment process&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many SaaS companies rely on feature differentiation as a way to justify higher
prices, but this produces higher&amp;nbsp;churn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value metrics outperform feature differentiation with upto 75% less churn&amp;#8230;
Outcome based value metrics reduce church by an additional 40%.&amp;nbsp;Apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good value metric is easy for a customer to understand. They need to immediately understand what they&amp;#8217;re paying for and where they fit in your packing/pricing structure. If you&amp;#8217;re in an established market, it makes senses to look at what the competition&amp;nbsp;charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good value metric is aligned with the value that the customer receives through the product. Consider the low-level components of your high-level outcome. E.g. what low level actions are necessary to get the end result?  Sending lots of messages? Meeting lots of people? Finding lots of&amp;nbsp;things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good value metric grows with your customers usage of the valuable outcome.
   If customers get incredible value from the product, charge them more because
   the product is worth it. Also, if they aren&amp;#8217;t getting much value from the
   product, charge them&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t do user based pricing if you want to get lots of users - its a conflict
   of&amp;nbsp;interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re small, you can try different pricing strategies and iterate to&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask&amp;nbsp;yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do my best customers&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do my best customers not&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What features did my best customers try first when they were&amp;nbsp;on-boarding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the similarities along my best customers that led to&amp;nbsp;success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For churned customers, what were the main differences between them and the
   best customers? Were they in the ideal audience? Why did they church? What
   did they do or not do that good customers&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overview:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask good&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid bad&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it&amp;nbsp;casual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push for commitment and&amp;nbsp;advancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frame the meeting&amp;nbsp;well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the right, tight, customer&amp;nbsp;segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prep well, take good notes, review your&amp;nbsp;notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1 - Opinions are worthless, you want objective facts about what happened in the&amp;nbsp;past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out if people care about your idea by never mentioning&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing yourself not to mention your idea will force you to ask better&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your questions pass the mom test:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about their lives, not your&amp;nbsp;idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask about specifics in the past, not&amp;nbsp;hypotheticals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend most of your time listening, not&amp;nbsp;talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an overly optimistic&amp;nbsp;lie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 - Avoid bad data - Compliments, Fluff, Hypotheticals,&amp;nbsp;Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and they aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to tell you what to&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3 - Ask the Important Questions - You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you ask in each&amp;nbsp;conversation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search out the scary questions you&amp;#8217;ve been unintentionally avoiding. What&amp;#8217;s the worst thing a prospect could say?
What&amp;#8217;s the scariest question you could&amp;nbsp;ask? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good way to find scary questions is to imagine that your company has failed and then to ask&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get an unexpected answer to one of your questions and it doesn&amp;#8217;t have any effect on what you&amp;#8217;re going to do, then was it really worth asking&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General advice for hard things including asking hard questions - imagine you were delegating the task, what would you tel the person to do? That&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ask about&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love bad news - if you find out that your idea is fundamentally flawed you&amp;#8217;ve just saved a tonne of time and energy
and money. Move on. It&amp;#8217;s getting you closer to the&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad news isn&amp;#8217;t the result of an opinion. No one knows if your idea will work, only the market knows. Opinions don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lukewarm response to your idea can be a great conversation, because you realise that your idea isn&amp;#8217;t a great idea.
Lukewarm means they don&amp;#8217;t care enough to buy the first (worst) version before it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look before you zoom. Don&amp;#8217;t focus on details too soon, you need to understand the big picture&amp;nbsp;first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;product risk&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;customer risk&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product risk&lt;/strong&gt; - can I build it and grow&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer risk&lt;/strong&gt; - is there a big enough group of people who are going to buy&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-plan a list of the 3 most important questions (including a scary one) before every meeting or conversation. Be ready with these. They should change from week to week. As you get good quality answers to existing questions you can bring in new&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4 - Keep it casual, Structure: Problem -&amp;gt; Solution -&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Sales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normally you would have 3 meetings with a client in order to make a big sale. This lets you do each stage really well without blurring the data:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify your prospect&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain your&amp;nbsp;solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell the&amp;nbsp;solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying a problem doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be a meeting, keep it casual and you will get more honest feedback much
faster. It works better as a&amp;nbsp;chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It take 5 minutes (max) to identify if a problem exists and is&amp;nbsp;important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give as little info as possible about your idea whilst still nudging the conversation&amp;nbsp;along&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5 - The currencies of conversation - Time, Reputation,&amp;nbsp;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In early stage sales, the main goal is learning. Money is a&amp;nbsp;side-effect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone is willing to risk reputation, or spend time or money on your idea, then you can believe that they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing a compliment is still useful - it means they&amp;#8217;re trying to get rid of&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If its a bad meeting, push for a commitment of some kind. Ask them to spend time, reputation or money and you&amp;#8217;ll see what they really&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they aren&amp;#8217;t excited (not just interested, but in pain and excited for your solution) then you need to find that out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s still a good meeting if you can discover&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lead isn&amp;#8217;t a real lead until you&amp;#8217;ve given them a concrete chance to reject&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask learning questions by using the Mom Test, then confirm by selling&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need &lt;strong&gt;crazy customers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a painful and expensive&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They know they have a painful and expensive&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have the money to pay you to solve&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They already have their own bad solution to this terrible problem, and yours is clearly&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crazy customer doesn&amp;#8217;t say &amp;#8220;yeah that&amp;#8217;s great, im really intersted, let me know when its ready&amp;#8221;. They say &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AHHH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIFE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PAY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;!&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crazy customer will front you the money when all you have is a prototype made of&amp;nbsp;duct-tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crazy customer is the person reading you blog, searching for workarounds, when you haven&amp;#8217;t spent loads of marketing and lead&amp;nbsp;generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a crazy customer close - they&amp;#8217;ll stick with you when times are&amp;nbsp;tough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 6 - Finding good conversations - Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new&amp;nbsp;stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it&amp;#8217;s a topic you both care about, find an excuse. You&amp;#8217;ll both enjoy the chat. You don&amp;#8217;t need to mention your idea if it breaks the&amp;nbsp;premise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm introductions are the ideal way to start a new conversation. 6 degrees of freedom in the world, so find someone who knows someone who knows&amp;nbsp;someone..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold calls - LinkedIn,&amp;nbsp;maybe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serendipity - be prepared, be&amp;nbsp;bold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a good excuse -&amp;nbsp;hustle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landing pages so that googling the problems brings them to&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise an event - bring the businesses together for an event. You&amp;#8217;ll be considered an expert cos you&amp;#8217;re
facilitating&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become a subject matter&amp;nbsp;expert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking and teaching engagements - you get to have strong opinions, and you&amp;#8217;ll be&amp;nbsp;respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision -&amp;gt; Framing -&amp;gt; Weakness -&amp;gt; Pedestal -&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 7 - Choosing you&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups don&amp;#8217;t starve, they drown. In options, choices, ideas. You get&amp;nbsp;overwhelmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a good customer segment, focus on it, and don&amp;#8217;t get&amp;nbsp;distracted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the beginning:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - PhD&amp;nbsp;students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPal -&amp;nbsp;eBay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evernote  - Moms with recipes,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will look obvious with hindsight, probably not so obvious before you&amp;#8217;ve figured it out&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;#8217;t get a consistent answer to a question, maybe you&amp;#8217;re speaking to different&amp;nbsp;segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you aren&amp;#8217;t finding &lt;strong&gt;consistent problems and goals&lt;/strong&gt; then you don&amp;#8217;t have a specific enough customer segment&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the group, which type of person would want it the&amp;nbsp;most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would everyone within the group want to buy/use it? Or only&amp;nbsp;some?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does the subset want&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does everyone in the group have the same&amp;nbsp;motivation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other motivations are&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who else (outside the group) have these&amp;nbsp;motivations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for &lt;strong&gt;Who-Where&lt;/strong&gt; pairs of segments. &amp;#8220;Finance professionals who run&amp;nbsp;marathons&amp;#8221;..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want customers who are reachable, profitable, and personally&amp;nbsp;rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good segments are usually &amp;#8220;who-where&amp;#8221; pairs. If you don&amp;#8217;t know where to find your customers, keep slicing until you
do. Make sure the segment is reachable, profitable, and personally&amp;nbsp;rewarding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 8 - Getting the most from the conversations by prepping and&amp;nbsp;reviewing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare well&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you 3 big questions ready, including the scary&amp;nbsp;ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know who you are speaking&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know what commitment and next-steps you want to push&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend up to an hour &lt;strong&gt;writing down your best guesses about what you think they will say, what they care about and what they want.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a focussed segment, you&amp;#8217;ll only need to do this&amp;nbsp;occasionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whilst prepping, if you come across a question which can be answered using the internet, use the&amp;nbsp;internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take good notes&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask if you can record the&amp;nbsp;audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record emotions as well as words. Verbatim alone isn&amp;#8217;t always accurate 6 months&amp;nbsp;later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use shorthand for follow up, happy, angry, meh,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pains and obstacles are a lot more important if someone is embarrassed or angry when they&amp;#8217;re talking about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dig into the big emotions, find out what&amp;#8217;s causing them, or why its a big&amp;nbsp;deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review your notes&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta - which questions went well or&amp;nbsp;not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were the answers to the scary&amp;nbsp;questions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you do better next&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were the clear signals? What signals did you&amp;nbsp;miss?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to do better marketing, understand your value and differentiators&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what makes a best-fit&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning is a fundamental input to every business tactic you&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you fail at positioning, you fail at marketing and&amp;nbsp;sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning is &amp;#8220;conext setting&amp;#8221; for&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers need to be able to easily understand&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What your product&amp;nbsp;does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why it is&amp;nbsp;special&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why it matters to&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your prospects can&amp;#8217;t figure out what your product does quickly, they will invent a position for you. It might hide your key strengths or misunderstand your&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find people to demo your product to, then ask them to describe it back to you. Do the same with existing customers. If they&amp;#8217;re not saying the same thing then you have a positioning&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products with strong positioning:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the best kind of&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the value&amp;nbsp;obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell&amp;nbsp;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positioning as&amp;nbsp;context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without positioning to guide us, we don&amp;#8217;t know how to understnad a&amp;nbsp;product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning lets us make assumptions about&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who a product is&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what its main features&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much it&amp;nbsp;costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without it we would be paralyzed by choice, and we wouldnt be able to make sense of all the products around&amp;nbsp;us. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The context and purpose of a product from the founders/engineers perspective are often different to those of the&amp;nbsp;prospect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prodcuts can be positioned in multiple ways, and often the best positioning is not the default&amp;nbsp;positioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad positioning makes it harder for prospects to figure out if your product is worth thinking&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning requires considering:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers point of view - what problem/pain does it&amp;nbsp;solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ways your product is uniquely&amp;nbsp;different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characteristics of a potential&amp;nbsp;customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best market context to make your value uniquely&amp;nbsp;obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Five (plus one) components of effective&amp;nbsp;positioning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Alternatives - if you didnt exist, what would your customers use instead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its what your prospects would use to do the task if your product didnt exist. It could be excel, or pen and paper. It could be nothing, (in which case maybe you product doesnt solve a real pain&amp;nbsp;point.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably know a lot more about your market, and problem, and alternative solutions, than your prospects do. (&amp;#8220;Doing nothing&amp;#8221; could be an opportunity, not a red&amp;nbsp;flag.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its important to understand what customers will compare your product with, because this is how they will define &amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221;. Is it &amp;#8220;easier&amp;#8221; than a pen and&amp;nbsp;paper?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers might never have purchased a solution like yours&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Attributes - What do you have that alternative do not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could be:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery Model (online vs offline, installed on-site vs&amp;nbsp;not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business model (rental vs&amp;nbsp;purchase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific expertise (data scientist with financial and back-end web dev&amp;nbsp;expertise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value (and quantifiable objective proof) - What value do the attributes enable for customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If unique attributes are your secret sauce, the value is why someone might care about your secret&amp;nbsp;sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fact based, provable, demonstrable, quantifiable, objective. 3rd party oppinions are&amp;nbsp;relevant. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target market characterists - Who cares a lot about that value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on customers who are most likely to purchase quickly, wont ask for discounts, will tell their friends about&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should clearly identify who these are&amp;nbsp;and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identidy what sets them apart from other groups of customers. why are they uniquely likely to buy from you when others wouldnt or would take longer to consider and make a&amp;nbsp;purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Category - What context makes your value obvious to the ideal customer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declaring that your product exists in a certain market triggers a powerful set of&amp;nbsp;assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make these assumptions help you, not hinder&amp;nbsp;you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When presented with your product, customers will try to use what they already know to figure out what your product is all about and why its special. You want them to be able to do this really quickly and&amp;nbsp;easily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make these assumptions work for you, not against you. You won&amp;#8217;t have to list every feature, because most of them will be assumed by the context of the market&amp;nbsp;category. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get it right, and sales efforts (copy) wont be wasted battling those assumptions, but can instead build off of them to show secret sauce and value more&amp;nbsp;obviously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Bonus) Relevant Trends - what trends make your product relevant right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used carefully, trends can show prospoects why they should pay attention to your product right now. Increases&amp;nbsp;urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can increase urgency, excitement, coolness,&amp;nbsp;credibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but the trend must be directly relevant, practically and objectively&amp;nbsp;applicable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blockchains, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ML&lt;/span&gt; are trends - they are relevant to multiple&amp;nbsp;markets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these components is relevant to the&amp;nbsp;others&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="marketing"></category><category term="positioning"></category><category term="startups"></category><category term="book"></category></entry><entry><title>How I learnt toÂ code</title><link href="How-I-learnt-to-code.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-01T13:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-12-01T13:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-12-01:How-I-learnt-to-code.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;4 years ago I started learning how to code, and it was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult! It&amp;#8217;s still difficult, but I now have a collection of tools and perspectives that make it less daunting (more on that below). Leveling up requires one more
abstraction to wrap my head around, or one more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to understand. I can do&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#8217;t think it needed to be so difficult, so now I&amp;#8217;m building &lt;a href="https://codeschoolmeta.com"&gt;Code School Meta&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to learn how to&amp;nbsp;code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to code has been fun, ultimately successful, and life changing (hello job security!) but at the beginning it was sooo slow, and super&amp;nbsp;tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling like an imposter, and thinking that I was definitely not a real developer - I hadn&amp;#8217;t taken any classes in computer science. I felt like I knew almost nothing about&amp;nbsp;anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process began with Pandas, a (&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) Python analytics library. Spreadsheets were slowing me down at work, and I was bored. I found this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw"&gt;great tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by Brandon Rhodes. From there I found out about Jupyter Notebooks, and then I found about Github pages and how to make a blog using &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; (and also JavaScript, which I tried very hard to avoid for as long as possible). I felt like a monkey bashing a keyboard as I tried to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; elements do what I&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git was next, but I found this &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu/rys-git-tutorial.html"&gt;amazing tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to help me learn. It made Git seem &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, and also helped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; make more sense too.&amp;nbsp;Bonus! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suddenly realized that great learning materials are crucial if I was going to keep momentum and keep on enjoying the thrill of seeing the computer do something I hadn&amp;#8217;t made it do&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#8217;m now working on &lt;a href="https://codeschoolmeta.com"&gt;Code School: Meta&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s an online community to make it easier to teach yourself how to code - less confusion about how to get started or what to learn next, more encouragement, and lots of high quality&amp;nbsp;resources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marketing has three&amp;nbsp;phases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before (prospect) - get people to know you and indicate&amp;nbsp;interest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During (lead) - get the to like you and buy from you for the first&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After (customer) - get them to trust you, buy from you regularly, and refer new&amp;nbsp;customers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt;, all the other things are &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jargon free definition of&amp;nbsp;marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt; - The circus is coming to town, you paint a sign saying &amp;#8220;Circus coming to town on&amp;nbsp;Saturday&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotion&lt;/strong&gt; - Put the sign on the back of an elephant and walk it into&amp;nbsp;town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publicity&lt;/strong&gt; - Walk the elephant through the mayors flower beds and let a newspaper write about&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public relations&lt;/strong&gt; - Get the mayor to laugh about&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales&lt;/strong&gt; - the town people go to the circus, you explain how much fun the entertainment is, they buy some tickets, you answer their questions, they spend lots of money on food, games,&amp;nbsp;shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing&lt;/strong&gt; is the plan that made the whole thing&amp;nbsp;happen&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="Marketing"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning toÂ market</title><link href="marketing-101.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-19T12:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-11-19T12:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-11-19:marketing-101.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve learnt many things this year by being a solo technical founder, but so far marketing isn&amp;#8217;t one of them. I&amp;#8217;m trying to change&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since April I&amp;#8217;ve been able to work full time as a solo founder. I&amp;#8217;ve challenged myself to build something useful enough that customers would want to
pay for it and in the process of seeking that goal I&amp;#8217;ve become a much better
and more rounded&amp;nbsp;developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working solo for about 7 months now, and in that time I&amp;#8217;ve begun
using test driven development, I&amp;#8217;ve built non-trivial data driven web apps
using Django, and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt how to deploy and monitor those apps in
production and make them&amp;nbsp;performant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made two main apps; &lt;a href="https://moneybar.nl"&gt;moneybar.nl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pippip.email"&gt;pippip.email&lt;/a&gt;,
and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt so&amp;nbsp;much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m realising though, that I still have much to learn in other spheres. Being a
great developer is deeply meaningful to me. It&amp;#8217;s literally a bucket list item
for me and I intend to be writing code as long as I live. But there is no point creating products if no one knows they&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where marketing and positioning comes in. Right now it feels like I know nothing about how to get
users, or validate an idea, or position a product. These are all super necessary and super&amp;nbsp;unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more meta level, I&amp;#8217;m confronted with the lost benefits of working with co-foudners, or of having friends doing similar things. I want to work faster and
make progress more efficiently. I need to be part of a&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in isolation does have its advantages, though. I&amp;#8217;m self-taught and
self-directed, figuring out the contours of uncharted territory and creating my own
personal map. In my mind, I have a deep and almost personal relationship with the coding
abstractions and tools I&amp;#8217;ve learnt to work with. Classes and functions, strings and
floats, literally have (to me) their own textures, colors and weights when I
think or dream about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like I can pick up these abstractions as if they were
physical objects and turn them around to examine them. Place them next to each
other and compare the differences. Run thought experiements. In my experience,
this kind of relationship and affection simply doesn&amp;#8217;t happen when taking a
class or following someone elses schedule.
It&amp;#8217;s satisying to feel ownership of a skill like this, and it&amp;#8217;s one of the
primary reasons I consider coding to be similar to a&amp;nbsp;craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, now that I realise I need to validate my product,
position it, and figure out marketing, I&amp;#8217;ve stopped writing code, put down my
tools, and I&amp;#8217;m going to learn marketing. I&amp;#8217;ve bought some books. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll post some reviews here&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 weeks ago I had an idea for a product whilst reading a news&amp;nbsp;article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if the writing and sending of important messages could be

&lt;p&gt;6 weeks ago I had an idea for a product whilst reading a news&amp;nbsp;article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if the writing and sending of important messages could be
separated, so that I could write something long before I needed to send it, and
know that then sending would happen at the right time without having to think
about it. This could be useful for sending my daughter a message on her 15th
birthday, or to my wife on our 10th anniversary. I also designed a check-in
mechanism, so that messages could be sent if I disappeared or pass&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://PipPip.email"&gt;PipPip&lt;/a&gt; is the result - event-driven and scheduled email delivery, from days to&amp;nbsp;decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re working on validating the idea and finding the right niche&amp;nbsp;audience. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="PipPip"></category></entry><entry><title>BetweenÂ Clients</title><link href="between-clients.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-08T16:05:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-08T16:05:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-08:between-clients.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a freelance data scientist, I use time between client engagements to up-skill and pursue professional interests that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t otherwise be able&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of the summer I had time between engagements to work on some side projects and grapple with some new (to me) libraries and&amp;nbsp;technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;During August and September 2019,&amp;nbsp;I:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practiced creating websites using the &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;web-framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigated and demo&amp;#8217;ed &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/"&gt;django-plotly-dash&lt;/a&gt; - a library that allows exposing &lt;a href="https://dash.plot.ly"&gt;Plotly Dash&lt;/a&gt; apps to django&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built a personal finance dashboard using &lt;a href="https://dash.plot.ly"&gt;Plotly Dash&lt;/a&gt; and began turning it into a web app using &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/"&gt;django-plotly-dash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewed for a role at &lt;a href="https://coinmetrics.io"&gt;CoinMetrics.io&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu/btc-fork-analysis.html"&gt;this investigation&lt;/a&gt; as a technical&amp;nbsp;exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a company &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://atlasdata.nl"&gt;Atlas Consulting Internatonal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; to facilitate life as a freelance data scientist and&amp;nbsp;consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent a lot of time working at the cafe in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IKEA&lt;/span&gt; because my co-working space wouldn&amp;#8217;t let me stay late or work on public&amp;nbsp;holidays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduced myself to this &lt;a href="http://haarlemoffice.nl"&gt;new coworking space&lt;/a&gt; and suggested we could work together to create the best tech-focussed startup hub and coworking space in the&amp;nbsp;Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought our first car. It required a lot more time and research than I&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created &lt;a href="http://www.texnidata.com"&gt;Texni Data Consultancy&lt;/a&gt; with Dan Caputo to provide data strategy consultancy&amp;nbsp;services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built the website for &lt;a href="http://www.texnidata.com"&gt;Texni Data&lt;/a&gt; using django and deployed it to Heroku with a custom domain&amp;nbsp;name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployed a django app to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com"&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/"&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu"&gt;business website&lt;/a&gt; to represent my work as a freelance data scientist and made my &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; a subdomain of this&amp;nbsp;site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moved my blog off of github pages and onto &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com"&gt;firebase&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks Github for several years of simple trouble free&amp;nbsp;hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimented with using storage buckets on Google Cloud Platform to host static sites and serve them over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;. My conclusion is that serving static sites using storage buckets is great - it&amp;#8217;s simple, quick and cheap (free). But adding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; proved too difficult. I spent too many hours trying to create a loadbalancer that would work for both the root domain &lt;a href="https://johnmathews.eu"&gt;johnmathews.eu&lt;/a&gt; and also a subdomain &lt;a href="https://blog.johnmathews.eu"&gt;blog.johnmathews.eu&lt;/a&gt;. In the end I found out about firebase. Firebase is also quick and cheap (free) and simple enough to pick-up&amp;nbsp;quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a photo book using &lt;a href="https://www.photobox.co.uk"&gt;PhotoBox&lt;/a&gt; that turned out great. It covers the last 3.5 years and is mostly full of snapshots of our kids and selfies with&amp;nbsp;Ritsya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chose a primary school for my daughter to go to next&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Freelance"></category></entry><entry><title>A fasterÂ shell</title><link href="shell.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-14T11:32:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-02-14T11:32:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-02-14:shell.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;zsh was loading significantly slower than bash, so I used profiling to see what was slowing things&amp;nbsp;down&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Opening up a new shell was annoyingly slow. Not terrible, but enough to notice. Its a&amp;nbsp;niggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find out which components were causing the most delay, so I used
&lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; to measure how long it took to launch a shell. Even though shells
might appear to be part of the low level &amp;#8216;guts&amp;#8217; of a computer, each shell is
just an executable and can be treated as&amp;nbsp;such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure the startup speed of your shell,&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;seq &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; /usr/bin/time &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$SHELL&lt;/span&gt; -i -c exit&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="zsh profile" src="images/zsh_startup_speed.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that it takes 0.84 seconds to start &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; - not terrible, but not&amp;nbsp;great:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can compare the performance of different shells by replacing &lt;code&gt;$SHELL&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results if I used &lt;code&gt;BASH&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; - 9.3x faster! (but
without useful tools and plugins):
&lt;img alt="bash profile" src="images/bash_startup_speed.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I can measure how long it takes to start, it would be useful to know
which proccesses are causing the greatest delays. This could be done with
something like &lt;code&gt;zsh -xv&lt;/code&gt; which enables verbose output and xtrace. This creates
a tonne of output, but doesnt inlcude timestamps. All I really want is
a summary of how much time each subproccess required to run, i.e. an order blind&amp;nbsp;profiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;zmodload zsh/zprof&lt;/code&gt; at the start of &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;zprof&lt;/code&gt; at the very end.
Now when I start &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; I see the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="zsh startup components" src="images/zsh_order_blind_profiling.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps - make virtualenvwrapper run faster, or asyncronously, or
not at&amp;nbsp;all&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:
&lt;code&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code&gt; is the biggest cause of slow loading. Using the &lt;a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html"&gt;lazy
loadin&lt;/a&gt; option decreased loading time by&amp;nbsp;0.3s&lt;/p&gt;

Bitcoin cannot faciliate payments fast enough such that it could compete with Visa or&amp;nbsp;Mastercard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting solution to this problem is the &lt;a href="https://lightning.network/"&gt;Lightning protocol&lt;/a&gt; - a separate protocol that sits ontop of the Bitcoin protocol (a so-called &amp;#8216;Layer 2&amp;#8217; solution). Lightning uses hashed time locked contracts (HTLCs) to trustlessly and privately move transactions off-chain. This allows payments to be faster, cheaper and more frequent. It also has interesting implications for enhancing&amp;nbsp;privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of resources about what the Lightning network is, why it&amp;#8217;s neccesary and how it works. There are also several good guides available about how to set up and maintain a node. I used a Raspberry Pi with an external hdd. It took a few attempts, mostly because it&amp;#8217;s my first time working with an unix operating system and I tried to move a swap file to a disk that wasnt formmated as&amp;nbsp;ext4&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve opened and closed some channels, connected to peers, and made some transactions. I even bought some stickers using&amp;nbsp;Lightning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my node using these&amp;nbsp;details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market"&gt;prediction market&lt;/a&gt; allows people to bet on an unknown future event. For example, &amp;#8220;What will the Euro-Dollar exchange rate be on date&amp;nbsp;X?&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several common forecasting scenarios, prediction markets have been more accurate than polls, expert opinions, and statistical methods&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore prediction models are useful for observers (anybody who is interested in the     outcome) and not just the market&amp;#8217;s participants. Prediction markets can be used for categorical events (a specific event that either does or doesn&amp;#8217;t happen) or scalar events (when the outcome is between a range of values). The          predefined source of truth for the outcomes being predicted is called an&amp;nbsp;Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prediction markets enables participants to purchase shares or tokens tied to the outcome of a specific future event. Once the event has occurred, holders of the tokens representing the actual outcome will receive a reward of predefined value. This creates an incentive to hold tokens corresponding to the correct outcome, and the market dynamics of supply and demand allow the price to reflect perceived probabilities of different outcomes. Helpfully, the price of each   type of token corresponds to the relative probability of each outcome occurring which allows for simple interpretation of the results. If the reward for holding a share corresponding to the correct outcome is $1, and the present price  of this share is 50 cents, then the market&amp;#8217;s estimate of the likelihood of this outcome occurring is&amp;nbsp;50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares can be traded continuously. As trading occurs over time the probability of different outcomes will change as new information becomes known, and the changing price of the shares quantify&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An&amp;nbsp;example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s describe how this could work with an&amp;nbsp;example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large degree of uncertainty&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; around how Britain will continue to trade with the other European countries when it exits the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; on March 29, 2019. A prediction market will likely be a better predictor of the outcome than    any other&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an adequate agreement isn&amp;#8217;t achieved, Britain&amp;#8217;s main port at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Dover"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt; will certainly experience long delays and large traffic jams. Therefore a prediction market asking &amp;#8220;How many vehicles  will be admitted into Britain at the port of Dover between 00:00 and 23:59 on March 29 2019?&amp;#8221; will give a useful prediction about the outcome of Britain&amp;#8217;s trade negotiations - a key component and sticking point in the Brexit&amp;nbsp;negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each type of token in the prediction market will correspond to different quantities of vehicles entering the port&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - for example there could be four (or more) categories; Less than 8000, between 8000 and 11000, between 11000 and     14000, and more than 14000. The relative price of a share in each category will correspond to the relative probabilities of each possible&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the number of vehicles is lower than would otherwise be expected, (around 12000) this would likely be due to the impact of Brexit and thus the market will serve as a useful proxy for predicting what kind of Brexit will&amp;nbsp;occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stakeholder incentives are&amp;nbsp;aligned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason that prediction markets work so well is because they aggregate information from disparate sources and the price shows not only an impartial assessment of the most likely outcome but the aggregated level of confidence that    the participants have. Since no one is obliged to participate, those that do believe they have valuable information which gives them a competitive advantage. This creates a mechanism that moves good quality information into the         prediction market, with the resulting prices reflecting the probability of a range of&amp;nbsp;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, people with relevant information would include port employees, business owners in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and in Europe, politicians, civil servants, business analysts, bankers, etc. Whilst it is clear that any of these roles may have   useful information or judgement about the outcome, it is not clear how useful each participants role is relative to the others. By allowing a participant to bid for as many shares in as many different categories as they want, each      participant&amp;#8217;s confidence in their information can be&amp;nbsp;quantified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, prediction markets align the incentives of market participants and observers. If the market is large enough then it becomes prohibitively expensive to distort the market and promote poor quality information, including      information designed to create &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUD&lt;/span&gt; (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), fake news, or alternative&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;providers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prediction markets are nothing new, with political betting being used to make predictions as early as the 1500s. However the adoption of the internet and decentralised networks now allow prediction markets to be used more widely and    cheaply than ever before. Gnosis is building a platform on the Ethereum blockchain on which others can build new applications which harness the power of prediction&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By lowering the cost and complexity of creating a prediction market, observers can benefit from high quality and impartial predictive information about future events, and market participants are rewarded for accurate assessments of     likely outcomes. This will enable better decision making and empower observers with previously unobtainable insight. In our example, the market could be created and funded by any organisation that would benefit from knowing the results of the prediction market. This could be the port of Dover itself, news organisations, or market research firms. Any of these businesses would benefit from an accurate&amp;nbsp;prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s free, robust, comprehensive, and there is a plethora of resources that are easy to&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually find the commands difficult to remember though, and the concepts which Git is built on often seem counter-intuitive to me. This means I spend a lot of time searching for answers and trying to remember how I can use Git to experiment with a project without fear of losing any hard won&amp;nbsp;progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ry&amp;#8217;s Git Tutorial by Ryan Hodson is the best way to learn Git that I have come across. Its simple, practical, and clear. The reader learns how to use Git yy creating and maintaining a simple website. This gives the Git commands a meaningful context, which makes them a lot easier to remember and use in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial was first published in 2012 and the website which originally hosted the examples no longer exists. Each tutorial chapter starts with a link to download the project files up to that point, so the reader doesn&amp;#8217;t need to start at the beginning but can jump into any part of the guide. Unfortunately these links are dead&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I&amp;#8217;m hosting the tutorial here so that it continues to be useful. If the author would like to get in touch, please do. I&amp;#8217;d like to keep this great resource available so that others can benefit from&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

This truth is in the process of going from self evident, to assumed, to&amp;nbsp;denied.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A useful model I&amp;#8217;ve come across states that it takes three generations for a society to deny something previously considered true. The first generation studies or experiences something which leads to a particular value or belief. The second generation inherits the belief and assumes it to be true, but doesn&amp;#8217;t arrive at the belief through their own critical thought. The third generation then questions the assumption, realises that most holders of the belief do not have a good basis for their belief, and disregards&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belief that people have a responsibility to look after each other and treat each other with a minimum level of respect seems to be following this&amp;nbsp;route.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That humans inherently deserve a degree of respect and dignity simply because they are human is self-evident. In times of comfort and excess it could be ignored, but in times of calamity and in the aftermath of disasters it becomes undeniable and obvious. This is partly because disasters reveal our instinct for justice and our frailty in the face of&amp;nbsp;misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is experienced through the lens of the mind, and its perception is mostly governed by fundamental circumstances or desires. The trappings of a prosperous society allows this reality to be covered by a veneer of soft arguments, or rejected in favor of a viewpoint that says we have superseded these supposedly basic&amp;nbsp;origins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good leaders should know better. They should study history and be self-aware. In the past they have forgotten this reality and have been forced to relearn it at great cost. Are we about to forget, again, and let our children live with those&amp;nbsp;consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfathers generation saw the damage that sectarian systems bring, and were forced to answer questions around how much respect people deserve only because they are people. As the consequences of different views and systems became evident, my fathers generation assumed the answers to be self-evident, because the consequences of the previous &amp;#8220;forgetting&amp;#8221; were still&amp;nbsp;clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is clearly articulating this now? This&amp;nbsp;year? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we discuss taxation, social mobility, migration, military intervention, why do we not start with the assumed self-evident truth that people are inherently valuable and important? Humans are more than metrics, and cannot be entirely evaluated using only quantitative&amp;nbsp;methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horton, the title character in &amp;#8220;Horton Hears a Who&amp;#8221; by Dr. Zeus, understood this. He went to great lengths to protect the tiny and weak people in who-ville. We teach this truth to our children, but do not demonstrate it as adults. Jesus also understood it. He said that we should love our neighbours, and explained that our neighbours are people we come across who need our&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if forgetting that humans are inherently worthy of respect is a prerequisite for&amp;nbsp;declining;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;standards of&amp;nbsp;governance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Here are a few things that come to&amp;nbsp;mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâm not your financial advisor and this is not financial advice. These are my personal opinions&amp;nbsp;only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t invest what you can&amp;#8217;t afford to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the price falls 50%, you need to be able to wait whilst the price&amp;nbsp;recovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much you can afford to invest. Consider how much cash you will need over the next year, how long it would take to recover any losses,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long you want to invest it&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much you want to&amp;nbsp;make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to get good at identifying and ignoring the following, even from your&amp;nbsp;friends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hype&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake&amp;nbsp;news &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUD&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t trust.&amp;nbsp;Verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point 5 is really important and one of the best reasons to invest - money has an intensely psychological quality about it, and crypto currencies are the most intense trading experience there is right&amp;nbsp;now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting something you care about in a risky situation (it is risky) you will experience anxiety and excitement. You need to control your psychology and identity when other people are trying to manipulate you. This is useful in all areas of&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost no one has a clue what&amp;#8217;s happening. Conventional economists and traders certainly don&amp;#8217;t. This is crypto-economics and the rules haven&amp;#8217;t been worked out yet. We&amp;#8217;ve never had this tech before, and the internet has made everything - communication and innovation - much quicker. This is a powerful combination of factors and we haven&amp;#8217;t seen them play out&amp;nbsp;before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to read about the fundamentals and understand the tech as much as you can. Think about why people would behave in certain ways and what makes bitcoin useful, or not. Get started on this today, it will take some&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube has a tonne of videos, and these two sites are good and detailed (&lt;a href="http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter has a lot of current and new information, but also a lot of bots and scammers spreading hype and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUD&lt;/span&gt; (see point 4). You can see who I follow on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnmathews/following"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re going to lose sleep over your investment, invest&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t buy at an all time high. Do your research, wait for the price to correct.  &lt;em&gt;Prices fall.&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;a href="https://uk.tradingview.com/x/TrL9SA7o/"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; below shows the 20 day and 55 day moving average compared to the daily price. My opinion is that by early January the price will have returned to between the 20 day and 55 day average before beginning to rise&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coinbase.com"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; is a user friendly and reputable exchange, there are other good exchanges&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t make financial decisions when you&amp;#8217;re feeling rushed. Check your&amp;nbsp;psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve bought some Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, don&amp;#8217;t store them on an exchange. Transfer them to a wallet that you control. If you don&amp;#8217;t own your private key, you don&amp;#8217;t own the asset. If you don&amp;#8217;t know what that means, go to point&amp;nbsp;8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave a comment if you think I&amp;#8217;ve missed something or if you&amp;nbsp;disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many countries the ability to create legally binding agreements is not available to average citizens. Legal services are often unaffordable and opaque, or service providers are corrupt. Legal services are in need of&amp;nbsp;disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pangea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitnation (who I consult for) intends to address this problem by empowering people to self-organise and self-govern. We are building a platform called Pangea which allows users to create, notarise and arbitrate contracts according to a jurisdiction which each party joins voluntarily, irrespective of their geographical&amp;nbsp;location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangea is a smart phone app that looks and feels like a chat app, the back-end (called Panthalassa) is an encrypted mesh network hooked up to the Ethereum&amp;nbsp;blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rewarded for doing good, empowered to be a responsible&amp;nbsp;citizen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Pangea, people are incentivised to be good citizens by receiving rewards for doing good, rather than being coerced by the threat of punishment for bad&amp;nbsp;behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This platform would fulfil a vast and unmet need, particularly in countries whose legal systems function poorly. On Pangea, a user voluntarily chooses which jurisdiction to be a part of. Contracts are then notarised, executed and arbitrated according to that jurisdiction. Users voluntarily join a decentralised borderless voluntary nation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBVN&lt;/span&gt;) and will receive tokens (Pangea Arbitration Tokens) as a reward for good behaviour. The tokens will be tradable and will be used as payment on Pangea for notarisation and arbitration&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Combining a store of value and access to legal&amp;nbsp;services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies cannot escape their need to use currency as stores of value. They also cannot escape their need to create reliable and enforceable agreements (contracts) with each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating Bitcoin through proof of work occurs because individuals believe that Bitcoin will be continuously used â that it will meet an ongoing need to transact using a decentralised and disintermediated&amp;nbsp;method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PAT&lt;/span&gt; by being a good citizen will occur because individuals believe that Pangea will be continuously used  â that it will meet an ongoing need to create enforceable agreements using a voluntary and geographically agnostic (and decentralised)&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much still to say about the Pangea platform and the mechanisms which will make it function. Please give feedback and ask questions in the comments.

Historically, the safest asset you can buy has been gold. This is not because of anything inherently special about gold, but because that is what people believe to be the best long term method of storing&amp;nbsp;value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People believe gold is special because they assume that in future other people will believe it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Criteria for a safe haven&amp;nbsp;asset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safe-haven asset must fulfil the following&amp;nbsp;criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price isn&amp;#8217;t controlled by any single party, including a state or bank. The market is spread out beyond the reach of any one organisation. This is important because an asset which is issued, controlled or backed by an organisation has its value tied to the health of that&amp;nbsp;organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply isn&amp;#8217;t controlled by any single party, including a state, bank or anyone else - it exists naturally and the rate at which it&amp;#8217;s produced or traded is beyond the control of any one&amp;nbsp;organisation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply is limited. The effort required to create the asset naturally limits the&amp;nbsp;supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The asset doesn&amp;#8217;t wear out or&amp;nbsp;expire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s prohibitively expensive to&amp;nbsp;fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost everyone considers it to be precious and&amp;nbsp;valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be stored and transported simply. It&amp;#8217;s not delicate or&amp;nbsp;volatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, and because of historical consensus, people have been happy to use gold as a store of value in times of economic uncertainty or for long durations. Other assets also meets these requirements to lesser&amp;nbsp;extents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin compared to&amp;nbsp;gold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider why gold is so good as a safe haven asset and long term value store. For all the reasons above, bitcoin is better, except one: At present, not many people consider it to be precious and valuable, so the market is small. This will change as confidence and awareness increases, and the eco-system of services and applications&amp;nbsp;matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamentals are already&amp;nbsp;established:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decentralised network ensures that Bitcoin can&amp;#8217;t be regulated or controlled by a single government or organisation. The network can&amp;#8217;t be turned off or&amp;nbsp;controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The present and future rate of supply is publicly available and inviolable. This increases market efficiency and creates more rational pricing than a market where the rate of supply is&amp;nbsp;unverifiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply is naturally (mathematically) limited using proof of work&amp;nbsp;algorithms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin doesn&amp;#8217;t corrode or wear&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is impossible to&amp;nbsp;fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin can be stored and transported more easily than gold. - If you can remember 24 words you can transport all your bitcoin effortlessly where ever you&amp;nbsp;go. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A good solution would solve the following&amp;nbsp;problems:&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is a hardware&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hardware wallet (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallet) is a physical device that stores the information required to access digital currency or assets. It is plugged into a computer via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; in order to initiate or confirm transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other digital asset blockchain&amp;nbsp;networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are a secure method of storing cryptographic data. They are so secure that they can be used on a compromised computer. All that is needed to access funds using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallet (in addition to the device itself) is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIN&lt;/span&gt; code which the user chooses. A single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallet can store multiple currencies in multiple&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallets are an easier solution than remembering a good password, and safer than storing the data in a file on my computer or&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best known hardware wallet brands are &lt;a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/"&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://trezor.io/"&gt;Trezor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallets are technically great, but their size and shape creates a bad user experience. A good hardware wallet should be convenient to use multiple times each day, like a credit card&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current hardware wallets don&amp;#8217;t fit into a (money) wallet and people don&amp;#8217;t want to carry more any objects in their pockets. They are too big and are a bad&amp;nbsp;shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallets look like they might belong on a keyring, but it&amp;#8217;s inconvenient and insecure to attach a credit card to a keyring and the same is true for an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallet. I might store my keys on a hook by my door, but I would never leave my wallet there overnight. I often want to keep my keys and money separate because I need my keys when Iâm near my house, where I donât need to buy stuff, and I need my money when Iâm away from my house where I donât need to unlock&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep my bank cards and cash together in one safe place, and I donât want to carry around a dongle as well. It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs easier to have a separate dongle lost or stolen than something that would fit next to my credit card in my wallet. The inconvenience is a barrier to enjoying the advantages of digital&amp;nbsp;currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; wallet that is the size and shape of a credit card, it could be 3 times thicker than a credit card and still fit in a normal wallet. It&amp;nbsp;needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a display - it could be a low resolution b&amp;amp;w&amp;nbsp;display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two or more&amp;nbsp;buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to  plug into a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;securely sign transactions and create&amp;nbsp;addresses&lt;/li&gt;

I ran around Dublin visiting as many as&amp;nbsp;possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking to rent a hotdesk, which means I don&amp;#8217;t have any storage space at the office and I don&amp;#8217;t have a particular&amp;nbsp;desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are my impressions of eight businesses offering either hot desks or dedicated desks, ranked in order of preference. It&amp;#8217;s subjective. The going rate in Dublin seems to be â¬200 â â¬300 per month for a hot desk. Hours range from 9am - 7pm Monday - Friday, to&amp;nbsp;24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First place: &lt;a href="http://dogpatchlabs.com/"&gt;Dogpatch&amp;nbsp;Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogpatch offer a coworking space and access to a community of tech startups. They run regular networking and mentoring events and occupy 3 floors of a warehouse next to an old dock. The offices have a range of interiors styles. The middle level is fairly standard but pleasant open plan offices, the top floor is a flexible working space with event areas. The lower level is a series of vaults that each contain meeting rooms of various sizes. There&amp;#8217;s a lot going on and there&amp;#8217;s a good buzz in the&amp;nbsp;air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of interior spaces is a big plus for me and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to being able to switch up my working environment through the day. There&amp;#8217;s a couple of kitchen areas, and a table football and table-tennis table on the top level. Access is 6am - midnight, and a hot desk is â¬200 per month. A dedicated desk is&amp;nbsp;â¬400. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogpatch occupy less than a quarter of the warehouse building, the remainder of the space is used as a shopping mall and a museum. In my opinion Dogpatch is by far the best value and if you&amp;#8217;re working in tech it&amp;#8217;ll probably be your go-to&amp;nbsp;solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second place: &lt;a href="http://studio9.ie/?page_id=223"&gt;Studio9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys are great. The space is a lot smaller that Dogpatch, comprising only ~12 desks. It&amp;#8217;s a basement, but don&amp;#8217;t let that put you off â its open plan and has large windows at either end. The space is well designed and uses a lot of light colours and textures, including wood on the walls and floors. There are also plenty of pot plants. These combine to give a bright and airy atmosphere that feels very natural and&amp;nbsp;bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alcoves down one side of the main room which serve as meeting rooms, and a garden and basic kitchen at the back. The owners want the space to foster a community, and I expect that this is achieved. There are no dedicated offices and no teams using multiple desks, everyone is an independent&amp;nbsp;worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desks are large, and each has its own little wall to provide some privacy. â¬200 per month ongoing, or â¬250 for just one month. They offer a trial day for&amp;nbsp;free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Third place: &lt;a href="http://www.officesuites.ie/locations/20-harcourt-street/"&gt;OfficeSuites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building looks well run and appears clean and fresh with adequate resources. The building is an old Georgian tenement with high ceilings, cornicing and lots of natural light. The furnishings and decor lean towards corporate rather than something more interesting, but this works well to add a professional feel to the homely architecture. Access is&amp;nbsp;24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s only two rooms for hotdesking, and most of the building is given to private offices. There&amp;#8217;s a garden with bike storage, meeting rooms and a quiet room for calls. Lockers are extra. They also offer a free day as a&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬249 p/m for desk access 9am-7pm Monday -&amp;nbsp;Friday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fourth place: &lt;a href="https://www.element78.co/"&gt;Element78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendly and well resourced, but very corporate. The architecture is corporate glass and steel. They&amp;#8217;re situated on the ground floor in a posh business district with large financials for neighbours. It&amp;#8217;s too corporate for me, but if you wanted an impressive place to meet clients and a nice address, this could be it. There were about 15 hot-desks for rent, plus plenty of dedicated desks. Clients seemed to include mostly young tech companies and tech&amp;nbsp;freelancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hoping to find somewhere with more of a community, more inspiring architecture, and more character. I was offered a free day as a&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬200 for the first month then â¬350&amp;nbsp;p/m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fifth place: &lt;a href="https://glandore.co/flexible-workspace.aspx#Hot-Desk"&gt;Glandore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glandore offer a relatively luxurious package with a corporate feel. They have a few buildings in Dublin and only the flagship has hotdesking space. There&amp;#8217;s a super looking restaurant and a large club room to relax in, but these are features that I don&amp;#8217;t need, and the rates aren&amp;#8217;t competitive if all you need is a desk and somewhere to take calls. It&amp;#8217;s set up for teams and for impressing clients, and independent tech workers are probably better off&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬295&amp;nbsp;p/m &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sixth place: &lt;a href="https://www.regus.ie/office-space/ireland/dublin/dublin-4-ballsbridge"&gt;Regus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regus offer a polished on boarding experience and the friendly staff were quick to respond and generally helpful, but the office space was bland, grey and generic. The rooms I visited didn&amp;#8217;t have external windows and it reminded me of the rooms banks often put auditors in. If grey walls and tube lights are your thing then this is for you.  24/7 access, and meeting rooms equipped with&amp;nbsp;A/V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬299.70&amp;nbsp;p/m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seventh place: &lt;a href="http://www.cocreate.ie/"&gt;CoCreate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited the southern branch and thought the building was a bit shabby and needed a new layer of paint. I recognised the desks as some of the cheapest available from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IKEA&lt;/span&gt;. The rooms were small and needed cleaning, and there was weird art on the&amp;nbsp;wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of paying â¬200 a month to sit at a small wobbly desk put me off. The place was also almost deserted. Maybe their other branch is better, but this is not for&amp;nbsp;me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¬220&amp;nbsp;p/m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Last place: &lt;a href="http://tcubedublin.com/tcube/index.html"&gt;tCube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last and least, tCube seems to be putting in zero effort. When I visited I saw two rooms that needed painting, disorganised furniture and abandoned bits of computers lying around. The kitchen isn&amp;#8217;t high spec and the meeting room isn&amp;#8217;t big enough. I was also given a speech about how great the wifi was - a prerequisite that was taken for granted everywhere else. At â¬300 p/m for a dedicated desk its easy to find better value&amp;nbsp;elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="Freelance"></category><category term="Coworking"></category><category term="Dublin"></category><category term="Element78"></category><category term="Regus"></category><category term="OfficeSuites"></category><category term="CoCreate"></category><category term="Studio9"></category><category term="Glandore"></category><category term="tCube"></category></entry><entry><title>Bitnation</title><link href="bitnation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-14T11:25:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-09-14T11:25:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-09-14:bitnation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m about to begin consulting for &lt;a href="http://bitnation.co"&gt;Bitnation&lt;/a&gt; as their finance&amp;nbsp;officer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I begin working with &lt;a href="http://bitnation.co"&gt;Bitnation&lt;/a&gt; as their finance officer. I&amp;#8217;m excited about this because I get to work on a really ambitious project using new technology to do something innovative and&amp;nbsp;valuable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bitnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitnation&amp;#8217;s purpose is to offer the same services as governments do, in a way that delivers more benefit to&amp;nbsp;users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West this may not immediately sound like a big deal. Our governments are fairly organised and the services are usually &amp;#8220;good enough&amp;#8221;. Most significantly, we are not used to thinking about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; services (passports, visa, drivers licences) or registration services (land registry, marriage certificates) as a service that we are customers of - like our internet service provider, or our electricity&amp;nbsp;supplier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the world dysfunctional or unjust governments represent a huge obstacle to improving everyday life, the progress and achievement that many people can hope to realise is limited because of&amp;nbsp;this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was a viable alternative to a passport from a jurisdiction renowned for forgery, or a credit rating that acknowledged your land holdings despited your governments inability to maintain a credible database, then you could begin to travel, trade and enjoy the benefits that citizens of many western states take for&amp;nbsp;granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m excited that I get to use my skills in an innovative tech company that is aiming to do something really&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services include secure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; systems, asset registry and dispute resolution. Identification (in particular) is an area full of problems, and blockchain tech could offer some really significant improvements. Bitnation wants to create a platform where voluntary nations can be created and administered, and where people can choose what jurisdictional system they are part of. If this is widely implemented it will be&amp;nbsp;unprecedented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurisdictions would offer their own services according to their own principles, and because they are easy to create and membership is voluntarily, jurisdictions would compete to attract citizens. This should lead to improvements for the users of each service, and is intended to provide an alternative to the slow, expensive and opaque processing methods commonly associated with services from geographically defined&amp;nbsp;nationstates. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Bitnation"></category><category term="Blockchain"></category><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Identity"></category><category term="Consulting"></category><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>Create a Multi-Signature Ethereum wallet usingÂ Parity</title><link href="ethereum-parity-multisig-wallet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-12T22:28:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-08-12T22:28:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-12:ethereum-parity-multisig-wallet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Set up and use Parity to create and manage multi-signature Ethereum wallets, edit the wallet&amp;#8217;s settings and view pending and past&amp;nbsp;transactions&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently set up a multi-sig Ethereum wallet and I couldn&amp;#8217;t find clear instructions.  Here they are, I hope these instructions are useful for someone looking to get&amp;nbsp;started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in order to deploy a wallet. There are several apps that you can use. I&amp;#8217;ve used Parity because I found it simple and&amp;nbsp;quick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethereum&amp;nbsp;Wallets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallets are a type of contract and there are two types of wallet, the Multi-Sig wallet and the Watch wallet. An Ethereum account is required to communicate with a contract so if you want a multi-sig wallet with 3 signatories (for example) then you will need to have set up at least 1 of those 3 Ethereum accounts before creating the&amp;nbsp;wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their&amp;nbsp;website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrated directly into your Web browser, Parity is the fastest and most secure way of interacting with the Ethereum&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do a bunch of stuff with Parity including mining Ether, manage accounts, interact with different dapps, send/receive from different accounts, and set up contracts. On the accounts tab, you can quickly set up Multi-Signature wallets. If you use the Chrome plugin you will also get handy notifications when transactions are confirmed or contracts&amp;nbsp;deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download and open&amp;nbsp;Parity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For MacOS you can download and install Parity by visiting the Parity site and downloading the &lt;a href="https://parity.io/parity.html"&gt;installer&lt;/a&gt;, or from the terminal using curl or&amp;nbsp;Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple&amp;nbsp;option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   $ bash &amp;lt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;curl https://get.parity.io -kL&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed instructions are &lt;a href="https://github.com/paritytech/homebrew-paritytech"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   brew tap paritytech/paritytech
   brew install parity --stable
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you used the installer, then you open Parity opening the app and then using the logo in the&amp;nbsp;menubar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used Brew, then start Parity with the following&amp;nbsp;command &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then go to the following address in your&amp;nbsp;browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8180/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see something similar to&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity home screen view" src="images/parity-home.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add or create&amp;nbsp;accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity toolbar" src="images/Parity-toolbar-accounts.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity toolbar" src="images/parity-account-creation.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the Accounts tab from the top of the page and then select &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;+ Account&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;. Either create new accounts or import them using your preferred method. You don&amp;#8217;t need to import all the accounts that will be part of the multi-sig wallet, but you will need to import or create the account that will own the wallet you are about to create. This account will need to have a large enough Ether balance to pay the transaction costs to deploy the multi-sig wallet onto the Blockchain. The costs are tiny, but they are greater than&amp;nbsp;zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity toolbar" src="images/Parity-toolbar-wallet.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-wallet-details.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve either created or imported the account which will deploy the wallet, select &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;+ Wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; from the accounts tab and choose &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Sig wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;. Click&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter a &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; for the wallet, if you want you can add a local &lt;strong&gt;description&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;From account&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; will be the contract owner and this account&amp;nbsp;will &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be one of the&amp;nbsp;signatories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to have enough Ether to pay for the execution of the contract on the&amp;nbsp;blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the &amp;#8220;+&amp;#8221; button under &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Other wallet owners&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; to add the address of the other signatory accounts. You&amp;#8217;ll need to add one line for each signatory and these accounts will also own the wallet once it is&amp;nbsp;deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;required owners&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; section, specify how many accounts will need to approve a transaction that is above the daily transaction&amp;nbsp;limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;wallet day limit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; to set how much Ether can be spent by each account per day &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; needing another account to approve the transaction. Set an amount of 0 if you want all transactions to require approval, or turn the option off using the slider to the right (which just specifies a huge&amp;nbsp;number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;#8220;next&amp;#8221; and you&amp;#8217;ll be shown a pop-up window to approve the creation of the wallet. You will need to enter the password of the account which is creating the wallet, and once you click &amp;#8220;Confirm request&amp;#8221; the funds in the creators accounts will be used to deploy the contract on chain and create the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-conf-box.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding an existing multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your wallet is created and deployed, you&amp;#8217;ll need to add it to other parity clients so that the other signatories can make or confirm transactions, and view the wallets balance. This is done by adding a watch&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process: Accounts tab &amp;gt; + Wallet &amp;gt; Watch wallet &amp;gt; enter the address of the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other signatories will now be able to view the wallet&amp;#8217;s balance, get notifications about pending confirmations, and be able to make and monitor&amp;nbsp;transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing a multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can put funds into the wallet, just like a normal account. Just send Ether to the wallet&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="select multisig wallet" src="images/parity-select-multisig.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="select multisig wallet" src="images/new-parity-wallet.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the page you click &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; to change the local name and description of the&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; allows you add or remove owners (signatories) of the wallet and change the required number of approvals and the wallet day limit. If you change these settings then the changes will need to be executed on the blockchain and the account requesting the change will therefore need to pay the required funds. Depending on the settings being changed, other accounts will need to approve the changes before they are&amp;nbsp;implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; will remove the multi-sig wallet from your accounts&amp;nbsp;tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving funds out of a multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; in the wallet management window (pictured above) to begin withdrawing funds from the&amp;nbsp;wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the token you want to transfer - Ethereum is the only default&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sender address&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; - specify which account wants to withdraw the funds from the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipient address&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; - specify which account will receive the&amp;nbsp;funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount to transfer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; - specify how much you want to transfer. If the amount is greater than the remaining daily limit you will get a warning bar telling you the transaction will require confirmation from other wallet&amp;nbsp;owners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to specify the maximum transaction fee (a payment with a lower fee will be confirmed more slowly than usual) tick the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;advanced sending options&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicking &amp;#8220;send&amp;#8221; will bring you to the confirmation stage where you can enter the password for the account which is requesting the&amp;nbsp;transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If approval from other wallet owners is required and they are also using Parity, then they can see that their approval is required in two ways:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The signer tab will show there is a pending request.
    &lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-signer-alert.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wallet management window (accessed from the accounts tab) has a &amp;#8220;pending transactions&amp;#8221; section where any confirmation requests will be shown.
   &lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-wallet-management.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having made arrangements to leave London, it seems like a reasonable time to reflect on my time&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is a tough city to live in â it&amp;#8217;s big enough that a sub 1-hour commute is considered good, and it&amp;#8217;s super expensive. My stay in London has been defined by my quest to complete my graduate scheme and qualify as an&amp;nbsp;accountant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first arrived I had no idea what London or working in a corporate would be like. I was coming from academia, and my motivation for moving to finance could be summed up in two&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand more about the 2008 financial&amp;nbsp;crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get paid more for using mostly the same skills (math) as in&amp;nbsp;engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donât think thereâs anything wrong with these motivations, but I should have been making a long term career plan&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my job I was surprised at the 6 weeks of induction and hot-desking. Life as an auditor felt nomadic, as everyone would spend large amounts of time at client&amp;#8217;s offices, and no-one has their own desk in our office. The only thing you really own is your knowledge and your network of&amp;nbsp;relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I arrived with a high opinion of my employer and the view that I would be staying for several years. Having escaped the financial insecurity of short-term research grants, Iâd moved back to my home country to contribute to the system that educated me. I was happy to have a regular job with a decent, predictable&amp;nbsp;salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase that kept coming to mind back then was âaccountant factoryâ. Our training materials were scripted and everything was a standardised process. We were being processed. Graduates in, corporate accountants&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is huge and so are the efficiencies and barriers to competition that come with this. When I arrived I was impressed there were free biscuits, and it felt presumptuous to put a meeting in someones diary. Now I ignore any communications addressed to a mailing&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accountant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toughest experiences were related to the accountancy qualification. NaÃ¯vely I had believed that the qualification wouldnât be a big deal and I didnât give any thought to it when I applied â I just wanted to find out how banks worked. If there were some exams to be done then it would be fine, Iâd already achieved a PhD and I would handle&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be a mistake. A huge mistake. The alarm bells should have rung louder when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so that they could get the qualification (and were already intending to leave asap afterwards). Doing the pre-course work before college wasn&amp;#8217;t trivial. College - I was being sent to a classroom again. We were being taken out of the office, away from clients, and put in a classroom to prepare for these&amp;nbsp;examsâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant, without considering the effort and time involved to qualify was dumb. Itâs an oversight I find hard to&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disappointment and sadness at having to study again was profound. The teaching and assessment style was several steps behind what Iâd become used to. Compared to the depth, autonomy and research-focus of a doctorate, writing cookie-cutter essays in time-pressured exams felt stupid. The exams were hard and I failed several of them, probably because of my low morale whilst revising. Retaking them required more weekends and annual leave being spent away from my family, camped-out in libraries and&amp;nbsp;offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This required much patience and generosity from Ritsya, who having not seen me for long periods during my doctorate expected us to have a more normal lifestyle when we came to London. I found it miserable to pause my social life and other interests whilst studying, and then I would try to rush back to them when I had the time, knowing that soon Iâd have to pause them&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hadnât already studied in Vienna, this process of working and studying in London would have been exciting and felt valuable or special. Iâd passed enough exams though to know that theyâre never as important as theyâre made out to be, and whatever it was that was missing from my life wasnât going to be found in another&amp;nbsp;qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside though, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt; is the most practical qualification Iâve gained and has taught me many useful aspects of business and finance. Iâm glad to finally see business not as some mysterious system but something attainable and&amp;nbsp;understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in London has also required a lot of time on trains â my door to desk commute is about an hour each way, and Iâve never lived somewhere in London that hasnât felt transient. Weâve needed to live near a station and didnât want to commute more than an hour and thatâs put us in neighbourhoods with other young professionals who also donât have long term plans (or financial ability) to stay in the city. Weâre all looking to move on and move up as fast as possible.  I want to leave London partly because there are so many people with the same attitudes and priorities as my&amp;nbsp;ownâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate&amp;nbsp;Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the office I spent the first few months figuring out how people were organised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. I think it took me about a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years to feel like I could do all aspects of my job with certainty. There is a difference between how things are spoken about, and how things actually&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience has been that performance is all that matters and behaviour is defined by self-interest. I donât think this is different from previous environments I&amp;#8217;ve worked in â academia isn&amp;#8217;t any different&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the construction industry certainly isnât. I wonder if the only way people can endure it is if theyâve not experienced anything else, or think it normal, or necessary. I find myself wishing we could be kinder to each other, and that we could create structures that incentivise mutual&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate finance usually appears clean and well presented. Its people appear dependable and capable. The culture is sanitised and there&amp;#8217;s a lot of pressure to conform - you can see it in the clothes and accessories we wear and the jokes we tell each other in the&amp;nbsp;canteen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to see my office as a glass and steel cathedral. I read about the Middle East, and migrants arriving in Europe, and tower blocks burning, and felt really&amp;nbsp;disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we donât ask each other how we can help. Maybe we are too busy, or feel powerless to help. Apparently we do not know how to help, despite our wealth, talents, education and&amp;nbsp;connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember watching a man leave the office one day and thought that if he gave his whole career and left his firm after decades of service, there would be nothing left to identify him after a few weeks. The work will always get done. Market forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. The City rolls&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publications trump almost all other metrics, and the incentives to publish quantity over quality are such that risky or slow research is inexcusable. The metrics used to standardise success and allocate resources can be subverted just as well in academia as in any other industry. What management measures, the team prioritises.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of an introduction to the key features of a generalised blockchain. &lt;a href="blockchain-introduction.html"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; introduced key features of immutable record creation between 2 parties using public key cryptography. Part 2 explores how a network of users can maintain the same (true) list of transactions and protect each other against&amp;nbsp;fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broadcasting transactions to the&amp;nbsp;network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  &lt;a href="blockchain-introduction.html"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; we saw Lizzie, John and Chris exchanging coins. Lizzie also paid John with coins that were owed to her by Chris. These transactions were authenticated using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PKI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;which:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensured transaction&amp;nbsp;integrity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevented participants claiming that they didn&amp;#8217;t make a past&amp;nbsp;transaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevents anyone creating a transaction on someone else&amp;#8217;s behalf without their&amp;nbsp;consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the number of people in the network grows, the transfer of coins from one user to another becomes harder to track. If every users ledger is not identical then the opportunity arises to use coins that have already been spent to pay someone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know they&amp;#8217;ve already been&amp;nbsp;used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is double spending, and is possible because the ledger that is shared amongst all members of the group only has &lt;em&gt;weak consistency&lt;/em&gt; - it is not necessarily correct all the time in all&amp;nbsp;locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Weak&amp;nbsp;Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak consistency could be solved by requiring that everyone votes to accept a transaction before it is accepted into the ledger (Unanimous consensus), or to save time we could reduce the requirements so that only 50% of all users validate a transaction before it is accepted into the ledger (Quorum consensus). Either of these solutions is possible for a small local group with a list of all&amp;nbsp;users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However Unanimous or Quorum Consensus doesn&amp;#8217;t solve the weak consistency problem&amp;nbsp;if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group is&amp;nbsp;large&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group is small but spread across different locations or&amp;nbsp;timezones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not possible to know how many members there are and therefore what proportion of users are&amp;nbsp;participating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; identity of a user is&amp;nbsp;unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases a peer-to-peer network is required where transactions between users require approval by other users before being confirmed. This has not been trivial to solve, as some users would be incentivised to be dishonest, and some may make mistakes. This is the distributed consensus problem, which on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; is defined&amp;nbsp;as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus problem requires agreement among a number of agents for a single data value. Some of the processes (agents) may fail or be unreliable in other ways, so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow put forth their candidate values, communicate with one another, and agree on a single consensus&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distributed&amp;nbsp;Consensus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the number and identity of participants is known, distributed consensus is possible. Two types of protocol which allows all users in a distributed system to agree on a transaction are the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)"&gt;Paxos&lt;/a&gt; family of protocols and the &lt;a href="http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs5204/fall00/distributedDBMS/duckett/tpcp.html"&gt;Two-phase commit&lt;/a&gt; protocol. Both of these would require that at least 50% of all users reach agreement in order to add a new&amp;nbsp;transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in a public peer-to-peer network the total number of active users is not known - its  fast and cheap to create new user profiles, and existing user profiles may become dormant. This makes it impossible to know how many users 50% would be. Additionally, because its possible to cheaply create new user profiles (just generate a new public-private key pair), a single actor could generate and control many user accounts in order to have many votes and force incorrect transactions onto the ledger. An attack where one user subverts a network by creating many profiles is known as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack"&gt;Sybil attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proof of&amp;nbsp;Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to the Sybil attack is to increase the cost of verifying a transaction such that the cost exceeds the reward. This is achieved through proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms, which are computationally expensive for a sender claiming to have verified a transaction, and computationally simple for the receiver to verify that the sender has validated the&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible Proof of Work approach is to require that the hash of a verification message begins with a certain set of characters. The chosen set of characters is called a &lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; and the only way to create a verification message with an acceptable hash is to try many slightly different messages. For example, a nonce may be 3 zeros. It&amp;#8217;s arbitrary, but the longer the nonce is the more difficult it becomes to find a hash that fits the&amp;nbsp;requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because a hash is a random list of characters, and altering even a single part of the data being hashed will result in a completely different hash value. Therefore there is no way to predict a hash value. The only way to generate a hash with the required none is to  repeatedly alter the data being hashed (even by just one character) until a hash with the required features is randomly achieved. This is computationally expensive to achieve, but computationally simple to&amp;nbsp;verify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the method, a user who seeks to verify a transaction and broadcast the result must (once they&amp;#8217;ve verified the transactions) repeatedly try different messages until they randomly find a message that meets the nonce requirements. It is simple for a user to check if a transaction verification message meets the nonce requirements, because it is simple to inspect a hash and compare it to the&amp;nbsp;nonce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of this requirement is a process that makes it expensive to claim that a transaction has been verified and cheap to check that verification claim. This removes the threat of a Sybil attack, but does not remove the distributed consensus problems created by not&amp;nbsp;knowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The true identity of users in the&amp;nbsp;network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many users&amp;nbsp;exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem cannot be completely solved, and the practical solution is to relax the requirements such that the probability of accepting a fraudulent transaction is lower than some user defined threshold. This is acceptable because a user would require a higher degree of confirmation for a high-value transaction than they would for a low-value transaction, and would therefore be willing to incur more time and cost to verify a high value transaction and reduce the probability of accepting an incorrect transaction below a&amp;nbsp;threshold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user wishes to make fast or low-value transactions, or trusts the party they&amp;#8217;re transacting with, then they may accept a transaction without any other users on the network verifying that the sender has the required funds&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However when the senders trustworthiness is not assured, verification is required. The more risky or valuable the transaction, the more users the receiver of the funds will ask to verify that the sender has access to the required funds. The higher the number of users, the higher the probability that a dishonest transaction will be identified before being&amp;nbsp;accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appropriate level of verification will depend on the amount being transferred and how well the receiver of the funds knows the&amp;nbsp;sender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transaction&amp;nbsp;fees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking peers on the network to verify transactions introduces a new problem. Verifying a transaction requires time and effort, and incurs a cost. This cost requires that network participants be rewarded for correctly verifying transactions between other&amp;nbsp;participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker would only attack if the cost is less than the reward. Therefore the number and cost of verifications required should be just enough to make the cost of an attack more than the value of the&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introduces the problem that it costs more to verify a transaction than the value of the transaction itself. It is also create the recursive problem where the users who verified the first transaction would need to verify that the payment they received was then also valid. Furthermore, a high proportion of the original transaction value is spent as a transaction fee (for verification) which is not&amp;nbsp;efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems are avoided by combining multiple transactions and verifying them at the same time, broadcasting the successful verification of multiple transactions simultaneously by grouping the transactions together into a block of&amp;nbsp;transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By confirming multiple transactions at once (and proving it using proof-of-work), transaction fees can be aggregated (allowing each individual fee to be much lower). Each block includes a list of verified transactions, a reference to the previous block, and a block &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incentivised social&amp;nbsp;responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction verification process outlined above is remarkable because it creates a demand for new participants to the network by creating a financial incentive to verify transactions. This makes the network more secure as increasing the number of participants makes a sybil attack more&amp;nbsp;difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users generate new transactions and broadcast them on a peer-to-peer network for&amp;nbsp;verification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idle user listens for new transactions and collects them until the sum of all transactions&amp;#8217; verification fees is greater than the cost the user will incur to verify them and meet the proof-of-work&amp;nbsp;requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idle user adds an extra transaction to their list of transactions that transfers the sum of the transaction fees to their own&amp;nbsp;address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idle user generates the block of newly verified transactions, referencing the previously verified block so that transactions can be chronologically ordered and completing the proof-of-work challenge. This new block is then broadcast to the&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other users are listening for new block announcements. These users verify that the block is valid according to the proof-of-work requirements and the order of the&amp;nbsp;blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users with unverified transactions look inside the verified block to see if their pending transactions have been&amp;nbsp;accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competing to validate blocks of&amp;nbsp;transactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each user can choose which transactions they verify, and how many to verify before beginning the proof-of-work requirement and hopefully collecting the transaction fees. This lack of order around transaction verification is fine because the only way to increase the probability of being the first to claim the transaction fees associated with a collection of transactions (a block) is to spend more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; power searching for the required partial hash&amp;nbsp;collision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two users complete a block at approximately the same time then the blockchain will look different in different parts of the network, as each completed block begins to propagate and other users accept the new block and add it to their ledger. This is ok if a rule is enforced that requires a user to always accept the longest chain of&amp;nbsp;blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works because if multiple blocks are created at the same time, the time it takes to create subsequent blocks will vary due to the random behaviour of the proof-of-work algorithm. Therefore chains of different length will always exist and one version of the block chain will be longer than the others, providing a clear candidate for which branch of the blockchain to use. If there are transactions in the discarded branch which are not present in the new (longest) blockchain then they are added back into the pool of transactions awaiting&amp;nbsp;verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A block of transactions in never absolutely&amp;nbsp;immutable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above procedure for verifying transactions and adding new blocks onto the chain means that even if a user inspects a new block and sees that their transaction has been verified, its possible that in the future a longer chain will be discovered (which must be accepted) which doesn&amp;#8217;t include their&amp;nbsp;transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore any block could potentially be removed, which means a transaction is never completely verified. However the probability of a block being removed decreases as the number of blocks after it increases. This means verification can be thought of in terms of the number of blocks that have been added to the chain &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the block containing the&amp;nbsp;transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are willing to accept a high level of risk, or you trust the party you are transacting with you could opt for a small number of blocks to be added after the block containing your transaction. This has the benefit of increasing the speed of the transaction verification. If the transaction is risky or high-value, you might require a larger number of blocks to be added to the chain before accepting the transaction. This will increase the time required to verify the transaction, but reduce the probability that a longer chain will undo the block containing the transaction in&amp;nbsp;question. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Blockchains"></category><category term="Digital Currencies"></category><category term="Distributed Ledger Technology"></category><category term="Distributed Consensus"></category><category term="Sybil"></category></entry><entry><title>Move</title><link href="move.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-08T12:26:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-07-08T12:26:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-07-08:move.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Training&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;over&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Ambition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was 15, one of my ambitions has been to be an entrepreneur. I used to joke with my dad about buying him a nice boat one&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life so far has been predominantly about education, and that stage is over now. Iâm walking away from what I&amp;#8217;ve come to see as a lifestyle and career that has too many contradictions, it doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to live like this. Ultimately I want to develop multiple sources of passive income. I want to&amp;nbsp;create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer&amp;nbsp;2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been intense, with some weeks leaving me feeling ambitious and energetic, and others feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I need to get better at defining a goal, taking the quickest path there, and ignoring interesting&amp;nbsp;distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritsya is brave enough and imaginative enough to force me to think big and consider how to live a better life. My biggest fear is that I screw it up, shooting myself in the foot and Ritsya and my daughter also. We were headed safely to an unremarkable existence and it would be terrible to swap that for something worse. That won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I make better decisions and produce my best work under pressure, I thrive when I&amp;#8217;m perceived as an underdog. I need to accept this without using it as a reason to be foolish. Whilst I donât have a clear plan, or direction, or goal, (I have many of them) Iâve got skills and I want to see what I can make. Iâll never do my best work, using my most productive combination of skills and experiences, if Iâm a cog in someone else&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs safer being an employee than self-employed. I guess the price of removing self-employment risks is the difference between the value you generate for your employer and what youâre paid. I think those risks are overpriced, and most people are more capable than they realise. Sometimes you have to walk into a situation to find out how to make the most of it. And sometimes you have to leave a place in order to gain&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Autumn&amp;nbsp;2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year my boss gave me some advice that was supposed to be encouraging. Iâd requested to reduce my involvement with some stuff that was unrelated to my job so that I could contribute more to my team and still maintain some semblance of a work/life&amp;nbsp;balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss was pretty clear that reducing my involvement in the extra stuff would not be possible. During our conversation he advised me not to worry about how much I contributed to the team because âthe work will get done anywayâ. This was meant to be encouraging, but instead removed any conviction that the work I did was&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Flee</title><link href="flee.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T08:42:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T08:42:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-07-04:flee.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;They are looking for something that is innovative and&amp;nbsp;unproven.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A typical stake for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; could be roughly&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s want an exit price of at least 100m, otherwise their business models don&amp;#8217;t work&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10m can seem a lot for a founder with a 30% stake, but it&amp;#8217;s not enough to attract VCs, so aim&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&amp;nbsp;pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify specific people with real&amp;nbsp;needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size of&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your clear competitive advantage - why can no-one else do&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a large and attractive&amp;nbsp;marketâ¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a smart, skilled and cohesive&amp;nbsp;team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a strong ability to deliver quickly and to learn&amp;nbsp;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is ready to go big whatever it&amp;nbsp;takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a unique vision and&amp;nbsp;project-fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuable and differentiated&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient go-to-market and growth&amp;nbsp;channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable monetisation&amp;nbsp;strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability and&amp;nbsp;defensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show traction and that you&amp;#8217;ve cracked the important&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show ambitous and credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a capital-efficient growth&amp;nbsp;model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a clear strategy to scale and&amp;nbsp;win&lt;/li&gt;

Learn to leverage your time, you can never get it back. Being a successful founder is not impossible, it is always&amp;nbsp;exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whilst at the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; I went to a session called &amp;#8220;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve written generally about the summit &lt;a href="lis17.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oussama spoke with passion and humour. It&amp;#8217;s clear that he cares about encouraging would-be founders and confronting some of the cultural hurdles that exist in Europe. These are my notes from the&amp;nbsp;session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are serious about building something that matters then you have a great and exciting future&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can never predict who will be successful and who will fail. There are a lot of dumb successful people and clever founders can&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really important to learn how to leverage your time effectively. You can lose anything else and get it back but you can never recover the time you&amp;#8217;ve already&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to succeed is to try&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to do something that&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe you need to be more ambitious than average (measured against other countries) because the environment makes it harder to be an entrepreneur. (Attitudes to risk, comfort, security, expectations of failure.. are all unhelpful for&amp;nbsp;founders.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not impossible, just harder. So be more&amp;nbsp;ambitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is replaceable, no-one is&amp;nbsp;unique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can always lose money and replace it. There is so much money in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at Crunchbase and see the failure rate for companies that raised $1m - $10m, it is the same rate for those that raised&amp;nbsp;$10m+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you lose money on a project you will learn things from that experience and you can leverage that&amp;nbsp;learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;â¦ But you will never get back the time you&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zombies are companies that make enough money to survive but not enough to provide joy to the people in the company - aim high&amp;nbsp;andâ¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a company is a big deal, like starting a marriage. Think hard about what you will be doing, what problem you are trying to solve, who you will be working&amp;nbsp;with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe there is not enough money to go around and this makes pitching hard. Silicon Valley doesn&amp;#8217;t have this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average a startup in Europe will raise less than a startup in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe is irrationally concerned about risk. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is less concerned with risk and this is very&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So be pragmatic about&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate in London where the laws are good, even if you don&amp;#8217;t want to operate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. It has a better designed system of corporate law. Estonia is also&amp;nbsp;good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best European city for&amp;nbsp;founders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London, Paris,&amp;nbsp;Berlin..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a best city because none are&amp;nbsp;holistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London has the&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paris has engineering and product development (and no-one outside Paris knows the products&amp;nbsp;exist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin has automation and execution, execution and&amp;nbsp;scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¦You need to draw on all 3 of these cities, which when taken together can surpass Silicon&amp;nbsp;Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anecdotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of Slack lives in Vancouver with his wife and kids. He spends 1 day each week in California and everyone thinks Slack is Californian due to good marketing. Forget national pride, be pragmatic. Leverage the&amp;nbsp;internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of Airbnb would fly from New York to California for 1 day each week. They were originally in California where AirBnB started, but decided that if they could make it work in New York then AirBnB would be a success, so they moved to New York and flew back for meetings , etc. If you ask Europeans to come to a meeting in London (which is not as far as California is from New York) people start complaining and deciding they can&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;bothered. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="LIS"></category><category term="Startup"></category><category term="FinTech"></category><category term="Europe"></category></entry><entry><title>The Lisbon InvestmentÂ Summit</title><link href="lis17.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-06-09:lis17.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Lisbon investment Summit was full of Investors as well as Founders. The sessions were good enough but the real value was in the&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; on June 6 and 7 as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; InsurTech startup team with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jd_sullivan?lang=en-gb"&gt;John Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first startup conference I&amp;#8217;d been to and I arrived hoping to have some useful conversations and understand more about the Fintech and startup spaces in Europe. As usual I wanted to focus on tech, finance and&amp;nbsp;blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who was&amp;nbsp;there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as some outstanding sessions there was a high ratio of investors to startups. This made talking to VCs, bankers and M&amp;amp;A lawyers really easy. I was happy to meet a London-based and Fintech-focussed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; when I sat down to have lunch, and thanks to interrupting a session to ask blockchain related questions on Day 1, a banker struck up a conversation with me over breakfast the next day. I met a lot of people across many relevant roles, and once I&amp;#8217;ve worked through my notes and my new collection of business cards I hope to have some great follow-up&amp;nbsp;meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useful&amp;nbsp;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most useful sessions for me&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="ambitious.html"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thefamily.co"&gt;TheFamily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="investment.html"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Understanding Investment&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.partechventures.com"&gt;Partech&amp;nbsp;Ventures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Building successful businesses on blockchain technologies&amp;#8221; a panel discussion moderated by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kloaec?lang=en"&gt;Kevin Loaec&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="http://chainsmiths.com/"&gt;Chainsmiths&lt;/a&gt; blockchain consultancy, and including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mir_btc"&gt;Mir Serena Liponi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.blockchainlab.it/"&gt;Blockchain&amp;nbsp;Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain session was valuable because it&amp;#8217;s unusual to meet people who have been working in the blockchain space for several years. I&amp;#8217;m always wary of being distracted by the hype and noise around developments in the blockchain space so I appreciated hearing some informed and level-headed&amp;nbsp;opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political&amp;nbsp;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening session included a speech from the Mayor of Lisbon and the next day opened with a speech from the Secretary of Industry. Both speeches conveyed an open and progressive attitude to international cooperation aimed at promoting and supporting founders and startups in Portugal. The warm words were supported by practical measures including tax incentives and a state-backed scheme to match amounts contributed by private investors. It was really refreshing to hear a politician extol the virtues of multinational cooperation and bringing different cultures into Portugal. I wish Britain could do this&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Brexit, which inevitably arose due to London&amp;#8217;s present role as a centre of finance and innovation, it seems Europe is still expecting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; to come to its senses, and cannot understand why it&amp;#8217;s destroying its goodwill and reputation so&amp;nbsp;thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two days in Lisbon were full of useful and energetic conversations and it was a great experience pitching &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; multiple times and talking about what we&amp;#8217;re trying to do and how blockchains are a part of that. The opportunities to meet founders and investors are invaluable for making informed decisions. Lisbon is a beautiful city which I found easy to get around and always felt safe in. It&amp;#8217;s also refreshingly &lt;a href="london.html"&gt;affordable!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve added share buttons using a plugin which I modified and improved, and added meta tags to control how Twitter and Facebook show my articles in&amp;nbsp;feeds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach to building my blog is to keep it as simple as possible, only adding features when they make a significant improvement to how the content is understood and used. Therefore I&amp;#8217;ve done away with several features that would normally come baked into a WordPress theme. For example a footer full of links that would never be used, and a sidebar full of&amp;nbsp;distractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted for a single column design that hopefully presents text-heavy articles clearly and intuitively (please leave a comment and tell me what you&amp;nbsp;think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My use of plugins to extend Pelican&amp;#8217;s functionality reflects this, there is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/neighbors"&gt;Neighbors&lt;/a&gt; plugin so that the next or previous post can be accessed from the bottom of a post without going back to the index, and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/tag_cloud"&gt;Tag Cloud&lt;/a&gt; plugin to reflect which subjects are written about the most (and provide a link to all relevant&amp;nbsp;articles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of the site is important because a faster site is more enjoyable to use. Therefore I&amp;#8217;ve minified the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and the JavaScript using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/assets"&gt;Assets&lt;/a&gt; plugin. I&amp;#8217;ve also set the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and JavaScript to load asynchronously. Images are optimised using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/optimize_images"&gt;Optimize Images&lt;/a&gt; plugin so that their file size is as small as possible and they download quickly. The site uses CloudFlare&amp;#8217;s free &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; features so hopefully no matter when you view the site from you get a decent page&amp;nbsp;speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jinja&amp;nbsp;templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also arranged the homepage so that posts are shown by their category and then by posting date. This may not work very well with a larger number of posts, but I&amp;#8217;ll only consider that problem once it presents itself. Designing for hypotheticals or conditions that don&amp;#8217;t yet exist is a waste of&amp;nbsp;time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are examples of how I&amp;#8217;ve used Jinja templates below in the context of sharing my articles on Twitter and&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plugin: Share&amp;nbsp;Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that my posts were beginning to get tweeted about, so I thought it would be useful to have some sharing buttons at the bottom of each post for Twitter, Facebook and Email. Looking at the Pelican Plugins repo on Github showed there was (as usual) a plugin for this (called &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/share_post"&gt;Share Post&lt;/a&gt;), though I noted it hadn&amp;#8217;t been updated for a couple of&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing and initial set-up was simple thanks to the readme on the git repo. You need to copy the plugin folder to the plugins directory, and add the name of the plugin to the list in pelicanconf.py. Then you need to copy paste some Jinja/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; into the article.html template. That&amp;#8217;s enough to make it&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted though that when I shared to Twitter the text to be tweeted was encapsulated in quotes and there was a &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; at the front. I realised this was due to using Python 3.x when the plugin (which hadn&amp;#8217;t been updated for 2 years) was likely written for Python 2.x. A quick google and the obligatory trip to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SO&lt;/span&gt; showed me how to convert a bytes string to a normal text&amp;nbsp;string. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Python 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Python 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_as_byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_as_byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also found that an article couldn&amp;#8217;t be shared to twitter from a mobile device and this was due to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; being incorrectly formatted. The new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; format required separate arguments for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, additional text and the twitter&amp;nbsp;handle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Incorrect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;twitter_link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://twitter.com/home?status=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Correnct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;twitter_link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://twitter.com/share?url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;amp;text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;amp;via=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Using meta-data to specify tweet&amp;nbsp;text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be cool to add some default text to a tweet, as I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed this feature on other blogs when I&amp;#8217;ve found a post I wanted to share on Twitter. - A user may know they want to share an article but if they&amp;#8217;re in a hurry it might be hard to find the right words, so why not provide a ready-made tweet. The text is editable so it&amp;#8217;s only a&amp;nbsp;suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text would be different for each post so it makes sense to specify it when writing the article. The article &amp;#8216;summary&amp;#8217; would be too long, and I know that Pelican supports arbitrary meta-data tags. I assumed that Jinja would pick up the data the same way it picks up the &amp;#8216;standard&amp;#8217; meta-data and added a function to&amp;nbsp;share_post.py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;article_tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hasattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;tweet&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;html.parser&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once this function was working it was simply a case of calling the function and assigning the output to a variable I called &amp;#8220;Tweet&amp;#8221;, and then adding &amp;#8220;Tweet&amp;#8221; to the text string to be included in a tweets&amp;nbsp;text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;article_tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_as_byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_as_byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;t_handle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;twitter_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of fiddling around to make sure that the number of spaces between each part of the tweet was correct, but nothing as complicated as when making &lt;a href="time-until.html"&gt;Time Until&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specifying the text and image in a Facebook&amp;nbsp;share&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing to Facebook worked without any formatting problems, but it bugged me that the opening text of the article was being used in the preview that was shared to Facebook when I had a summary already prepared and that would be much more useful to potential readers. For some articles I also had an article image that I wanted to see being&amp;nbsp;used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling revealed that I needed to use particular meta tags in the webpage&amp;#8217;s header if I wanted to control what Facebook would pickup. Facebook uses the &amp;#8220;open graph&amp;#8221; standards so I would need the headers in my article pages to include the&amp;nbsp;following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;`&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Open Graph data --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;`
`&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;og:title&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Title Here&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;`
`&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;og:type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;article&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;`
`&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;og:url&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.example.com/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;`
`&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;og:image&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;http://example.com/image.jpg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;`
`&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;og:description&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Description Here&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I could see that I already had some meta tags being generated using the Jinja templates so I set about copy-pasting and modifying them to build the new tags. I had some issues with trailing white space or line breaks being included within the content string. This was solved like&amp;nbsp;so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;{# Adding &amp;#39;-&amp;#39; after and before the %&amp;#39;s strips white space and line breaks #}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;article.summary&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;article.summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;striptags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;truncate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;article.content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;striptags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;truncate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class="k"&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;endblock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also needed to use some blocks more than once, because a description tag was already included but Facebook wants an &amp;#8220;og:description&amp;#8221;, and Twitter wants a &amp;#8220;Twitter:Description&amp;#8221; too. All three of these tags will include the same text (generated in the Jinja2 snippet above). If a block only needs to be used once then it&amp;#8217;s generated like&amp;nbsp;this; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;description&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;endblock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But If you call &amp;#8220;{% block description %}{% endblock description %}&amp;#8221; again Jinja will throw you an error. The documentation (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SO&lt;/span&gt;) reveal that the solution is to&amp;nbsp;use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&amp;lt;meta property=&amp;quot;og:description&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;self.description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This allows you to reuse blocks multiple times and keep your templates&amp;nbsp;tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when I was testing Facebook to see if the correct text or image was being picked up I was initially frustrated to see that the new tags were not having any effect. This is because Facebook crawls your site and saves what it finds. If you want it to take a fresh look at your page with its new meta tags, you need to tell Facebook to crawl the page again, using the &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/"&gt;Facebook linter/debugger&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 1 of an introduction to the key features of a generalised blockchain. I haven&amp;#8217;t included references to Bitcoin or any particular digital currencies or blockchain implementations. This is because a digital currency is just one application of blockchain&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a financial document that cannot be forged or&amp;nbsp;disputed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s imagine there is a village somewhere where people still trade by bartering. John has some apples whilst Lizzie has some oranges. John would like an orange, and offers Lizzie an apple in exchange. She accepts, and writes John a&amp;nbsp;receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;Date: 1234&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Lizzie&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;To: John    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;What: 1 Orange  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;Price: 1 Apple  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. The receipt is evidence of the transaction. The next day John wants an orange but doesn&amp;#8217;t have anything to exchange. He offers to write Lizzie a note saying he owes Lizzie 1 orange (an  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). They think about this and agree that John should sign the note so that Lizzie can prove that John owes her 1&amp;nbsp;orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;Date: 1234&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;To: Lizzie&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;What: 1 Orange&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;Signed: John&amp;#39;s signature, Lizzie&amp;#39;s signature&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; is a nice gesture, but it&amp;#8217;s simple to forge. Lizzie has the only copy of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; and once Lizzie has seen Johns signature, she could easily copy it and create more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s. She could also change this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; from 1 orange to 11 oranges (for example) and John couldn&amp;#8217;t prove what the original amount was. If Lizzie and John disagreed over what was owed it would be impossible to know who was telling the truth. It&amp;#8217;s one person&amp;#8217;s word against the&amp;nbsp;other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizzie realises this and suggests an improvement - they will find a witness and make 3 copies of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt;. Each copy will be signed by Lizzie, John and the Witness. Lets call this witness&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Walter&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;Date: 1234&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;To: Lizzie&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;What: 1 Orange&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;Witness: Walter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;Signed: &amp;quot;John&amp;#39;s signature&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lizzie&amp;#39;s signature&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Walter&amp;#39;s signature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a much stronger document and is more difficult to forge. If Lizzie changes the &amp;#8220;What:&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;11 Oranges&amp;#8221;, both John and Walter will have copies of the original with her signature on it. It will be 2 pieces of evidence against Lizzie&amp;#8217;s 1. Lizzie will be laughed out of court.&amp;nbsp;Hahaha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Party transactions work pretty well, and this is how most transactions are recorded today. But there is a weakness: If Lizzie can bribe Walter then the transaction can be falsified! John would rely on Walter to verify his version of the transaction but would be let down by Walters lack of integrity. Lizzie and Walter could change 1 orange to 11 oranges and if Lizzie offered Walter some of the extra oranges this would give them both an incentive to forge the documentation. If Walter liked oranges enough, he might not care that his career as a witness will be&amp;nbsp;ruined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for modern financial systems and a great deal of time, money and regulation is devoted to trying to ensure that third parties are trustworthy. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;E.G.&lt;/span&gt; If I buy a car and my bank is in cahoots with the car dealership, I could be defrauded. Reducing this risk to an acceptably low level makes financial services slower and more expensive than they would otherwise need to&amp;nbsp;be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"&gt;public-key infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; (which is introduced in my &lt;a href="encryption.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;). In this system, each individual generates their own public-private key pair. They keep their private key private and make their public key freely available. A detailed description of public-key cryptography is out of scope for this post, but&amp;nbsp;briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public key is derived from a private key, and this pair together have a set of unique mathematical properties. Either key can be used to encrypt a message but only the other key can be used to decrypt it. You cannot use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. If the private key is used to encrypt then anybody can decrypt (because the public key is publicly available) and whilst this is clearly a terrible way to keep a secret it&amp;#8217;s a great way to verify who encrypted the message, because only one person has the private key. Because of this, using a private key to encrypt a message is effectively creating a digital signature which cannot be forged. (If the public key is used to encrypt a message then only the private key can be used to decrypt it, and this approach is used to transfer secret data&amp;nbsp;securely). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the fruit. If Lizzie wants to accept John&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; she can use public-key cryptography and no-one needs to worry about Walter. There are 3 steps to the&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1] Create the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; stating that John owes Lizzie 1&amp;nbsp;orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;Date: 1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;2] John creates a public private key pair and encrypts the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; using his private key. He adds an unencrypted &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;Date: 1234 To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;3] John makes his public key freely available to anyone who wants&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will work because anybody (not just Lizzie) can check that John signed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt;. The transaction can be verified by looking at the &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; part of that transaction, noticing that this transaction is supposedly from John and then using John&amp;#8217;s public key to decrypt the encoded &amp;#8220;signature&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signature can only be decrypted using John&amp;#8217;s public key if his private key was used to encrypt it. Because John is the only person with his private key, that proves the transaction is valid, and Lizzie isn&amp;#8217;t dishonestly creating a debt for John to&amp;nbsp;pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly if John discloses his private key (or its stolen) then he will make the system insecure, but this is a problem with John and his security protocols, not with public-key&amp;nbsp;cryptography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create and maintain an accurate list of&amp;nbsp;transactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;#8217;ve seen how 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; (for an orange) can be securely created, signed and verified. This process can extended to be used by more people to exchange more fruit.  For&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original&amp;nbsp;note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then some additional&amp;nbsp;transactions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 Apples &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 1 Banana &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 2 Bananas &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After these 4 transactions, between John, Chris and&amp;nbsp;Lizzie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John owes 1 orange to Lizzie and 1 banana to&amp;nbsp;Chris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizzie owes 2 apples to&amp;nbsp;John&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris owes 2 bananas to&amp;nbsp;Lizzie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is confusing, (and ridiculous). It is not possible to know who is the most in debt or who is the most wealthy. Lizzie owes 2 apples, but is owed 2 bananas and 1 apple. Does that mean her fruit business is losing money or making money? We cannot say. To be able to know we need to use the same unit of value for all the fruits. Lets say that an orange is worth 2 apples, and a banana is also worth 2 apples (therefore 1 banana = 1 orange.), also lets invent a currency called &amp;#8220;coins&amp;#8221; and say 1 apple is worth 1 coin. The 4 transactions can now be rewritten&amp;nbsp;as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John // Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 2 coins &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 coins &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 2 coins &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 4 coins &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By going through the list of transactions we can see&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John owes Lizzie and Chris 2 coins each, and is owed 2 coins from Lizzie. His net amount is&amp;nbsp;-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizzie owes John 2 coins but is owed 4 coins from Chris. Her net amount is&amp;nbsp;+2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris owes Lizzie 4 coins but is owed 2 coins from John. His net amount is&amp;nbsp;-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far Lizzie is the only person who appears to have any business&amp;nbsp;skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Lizzie wanted to use the 4 coins that she is owed by Chris to buy something from John? Could she use this system to transfer Chris&amp;#8217; promise to pay her 4 coins so that Chris would pay John instead? The fact that everyone can be sure that the record of the transactions is accurate and authentic allows a debt to be used as payment. Lizzie&amp;#8217;s transaction would look like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: ba781... &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8221; section contains a &lt;a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; of the original transaction (with Chris) that she wants to transfer to John. A hash is the signature for a file or some text and in this case it is the signature for Lizzie&amp;#8217;s transaction with Chris. The signature is unique to each transaction and identifies which transaction is being used as payment. Because both transactions are signed using Lizzie&amp;#8217;s private key, it is simple to verify that Lizzie has the right to use this previous transaction where she is owed (or paid) some coins as payment to another&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows how public-private key infrastructure can be used to securely record transactions and enable trade between a group of people, - under certain conditions. Blockchains can be used to transfer units of value like in this example, but we could just as easily put selfies or certificates of ownership (for houses, financial instruments, diamonds, etc) inside the &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8221; part of the transaction. If we make two other changes - removing the &amp;#8220;To&amp;#8221; part of the transaction, and including a hash of the transaction as part of the text which is signed using a private key. If we do this, then a record would&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;From: Chris // Date: 2345, What: &amp;quot;A photo of me&amp;quot; &amp;lt;- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This would create a reliable record of what Chris claims he looks like. He can confidently send anyone this record and if they have his public key then they can verify that it is Chris himself who signed it and is asserting that the photo is him. If somebody changed the photo then the data in the transaction would change and the transaction will have a new hash value. The new hash value will not match the hash value contained within the signature, and the text in the signature cannot be changed because it can only be encrypted using Chris&amp;#8217; private key, which only Chris has. Therefore it will be simple to show that someone other than Chris is trying to change the&amp;nbsp;photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another use for public-key cryptography arises if Chris were an employee in a bank, and the &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8221; contained documents about a customer the bank is providing financial services for. In this scenario, Chris (representing the bank) is effectively confirming the customer&amp;#8217;s true identity and documenting the evidence that&amp;#8217;s been collected to show that the bank knows who their customer really is. If the transaction included a new section called &amp;#8220;Customer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; (for example) then a database of all customers whose identity checks have been successfully completed can be made. This can be shared with other departments (or banks) easily and immutably. This is the concept behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KYC&lt;/span&gt; on a&amp;nbsp;blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our fruit traders: At the moment a participant is allowed to carry a net negative balance. For this system to work in reality, the creation of &amp;#8220;coins&amp;#8221; will need to be controlled in order to maintain their value. In the example above, people can freely create &amp;#8220;coins&amp;#8221; and can also carry negative amounts of &amp;#8220;coins&amp;#8221;. This would result in the value of a &amp;#8220;coin&amp;#8221; plummeting. Therefore their creation (and conversion from fruit) must be controlled in a predictable&amp;nbsp;manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our examples so far only include 3 people. If there are a lot of people in the network it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be feasible to insist that everyone is present or online each time a new transaction is added to the list (the chain) of transactions. However if we allow transactions to be added whilst some people are offline we create an opportunity for fraud. The reasons why, and the solution to this and other problems will be described in &lt;a href="blockchain-networks.html"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Blockchains"></category><category term="Digital Currencies"></category><category term="Distributed Ledger Technology"></category><category term="Public Key Cryptography"></category></entry><entry><title>London Rent vs. LondonÂ Salaries</title><link href="london.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-12T22:55:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-12T22:55:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-05-12:london.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Living in London is only financially possible if you are either single or household income is more than&amp;nbsp;Â£60k/year.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Living in London is expensive, everyone in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; knows this. Everyone knows that this is mostly due to the price of property, which we all enjoy talking&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve lived here for 3 years now, and when my wife and I were both working we lived comfortably. Two incomes under one roof is just fine. Not as fine as in many other cities, but reasonable. Just over a year ago my first child was born, and now that my wife&amp;#8217;s maternity pay has ended we are a single income household. This is not&amp;nbsp;fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I earn almost Â£50k/year, and any salary increase will be taxed at 40%, I cannot cover essential day-to-day costs. I&amp;#8217;m in the 40% tax bracket, and my basic monthly outgoings exceed my monthly take home pay by Â£400. If my employer wanted to pay me enough to cover essential costs, it would cost them approximately double the shortfall due to tax. None of this makes&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salaries and living expenses have become really&amp;nbsp;disconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people the most obvious way to increase wealth is to buy property. Mortgage repayments are cheaper than rent, and the value of the property increases over time. Double win. But there is a big hurdle to overcome before this is possible - saving money for a deposit on a house is often impossible without external help (i.e. the &amp;#8220;Bank of Mum and Dad&amp;#8221;), because so much of the money earnt must be spent on rent&amp;nbsp;first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a trap. Repayments on a mortgage are cheaper than paying rent, but you cannot save enough for a deposit&amp;nbsp;because;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so much of your salary goes to paying rent&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the average cost of a &lt;em&gt;flat&lt;/em&gt; in London is 500k&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which means a 5% deposit is Â£25k â which is a higher deposit than you would need anywhere else in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, despite being the place you are least able to accumulate&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if my partner went back to work and we put our baby in childcare? Childcare is not cheap, and working would need to bring in more than the cost of childcare. This requires a higher than average salary from a graduate job, (which is the life stage when people might reasonably start having children), so unless both parents are unusually high earners that option isnt viable&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in London is only financially possible if you are either single or household income is more than&amp;nbsp;Â£60k/year.&lt;/p&gt;

This is accomplished using a decentralised oracle based on prediction&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are my notes on the Ã¦ternity blockchain project, I&amp;#8217;m not affiliated with the Ã¦ternity&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ãternity is a new blockchain project that is pre-launch. The headline goal is to securely facilitate large volumes of smart-contracts which interface with external data sources. This is made possible via a decentralised oracle based on prediction markets. These terms are explained below. The Ã¦ternity project has proposed several notable technical&amp;nbsp;features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Contracts in&amp;nbsp;state-channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracles and native prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance by prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different types of&amp;nbsp;node &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Contracts in&amp;nbsp;state-channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart contract is a way to execute a contract without an intermediary (middle-man) and without&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart contract is a protocol which is stored and executed on a blockchain, executing transactions (outputs) based on specific inputs and programmable logic automatically. The logic often mirrors that contained in clauses of a written&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State channels are payment networks that exchange funds off-chain and periodically settle up accounts with the main blockchain. (The Bitcoin Lightning Network is creating a system for routing Bitcoin payments through state&amp;nbsp;channels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State channels increase scalability by making groups of transactions independent of each other. This allows them to be processed in&amp;nbsp;parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ã¦ternity proposes executing smart-contracts in Turing-complete state channels (Turing complete means, colloquially, real-world and general purpose), which should allow greater volumes of transactions, and make the smart contracts more secure and easier to&amp;nbsp;analyse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because executing the smart-contracts off-chain makes them private and the code used to execute the smart contract wonât need to be broadcast to the primary blockchain. This should increase processing capacity by allowing contracts to execute in&amp;nbsp;parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages to the state-channel approach include reduced transparency, as running smart contracts in state channels requires more trust in both the contract creator and the node running&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracles and prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Oracle functionality allows smart-contracts to interact with data outside the Ã¦ternity blockchain. This is possible by checking on-chain prediction market results and rewarding users who made the correct prediction. Users are rewarded through automated payments and the immediate recording of transactions in the blockchain. This creates incentives to participate in prediction markets, which have  been shown to be&amp;nbsp;effective. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-chain, rather than off-chain allows greater efficiency and&amp;nbsp;integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prediction market is expected to run using a native (on-chain) consensus procedure. The oracle mechanism is designed to use the same consensus&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Governance by prediction&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle functionality compliments prediction market&amp;nbsp;functionality. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prediction markets are proposed to implement governance of the Ã¦ternity blockchain. This is a new&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ã¦ternity protocol would be governed by user input. A prediction market will exist where changes to features and protocols would result in a higher token&amp;nbsp;value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incentive to increase the value of a token (Ãon) would allow the Ã¦ternity community to decide efficiently which changes to&amp;nbsp;implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low level protocol changes to variables like block times and block capacity could be&amp;nbsp;possible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consensus developed by the prediction market will initially provide input to the development teamâs&amp;nbsp;decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, a fully autonomous prediction market for governance is expected (a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAO&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; is normally used for large-scale systems that manage the allocation of scarce network resources (telecoms, banking, instant&amp;nbsp;messaging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could make it easier to run a lightning network and process many state-channels in&amp;nbsp;parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, ÃTernity is the first blockchain project to be written in&amp;nbsp;Erlang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different types of&amp;nbsp;node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ã¦ternity network will contain nodes with different functions. Each type of node will contribute towards the efficient functioning of particular aspects of the&amp;nbsp;network &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node types will&amp;nbsp;include &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity - Lots of channels and lots of users. Open a channel to issue a contract, for a&amp;nbsp;fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges - Trustless exchanges of assets offered by market makers. Profitable to market makers because of transaction&amp;nbsp;fees.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presumably features such as consensus algorithms and prediction markets will also require their own dedicated node types. Users of the node will incur transaction fees to participate, providing an incentive to run a&amp;nbsp;node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows a greater transaction volume, removing scalability problems that Bitcoin and Ethereum have&amp;nbsp;experienced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding works by splitting the space of possible accounts into subspaces (for example based on the first digit of a numerical&amp;nbsp;address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each shard gets a set of validators. Each validator validates 1 shard&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts and transactions within the same shard work as&amp;nbsp;normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts and transactions across shards require alternative techniques based on &amp;#8220;transaction&amp;nbsp;receipts&amp;#8221; &lt;/li&gt;

I tried several exchanges and chose the quickest, cheapest conversion&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On April 3rd, I happened to be Googling digital currencies and blockchain innovations when I came across the &lt;a href="http://www.Ãternity.com"&gt;Ãternity website&lt;/a&gt; and skimmed their &lt;a href="https://blockchain.Ãternity.com/%C3%A6ternity-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;. The project is ambitious, like many crypto projects, but seems well organised. The team is well known in the space. There is a clear plan to develop the project and create a blockchain technology that, if successful, could bring. A step change in the use of digital currencies for high volume low value transactions, and the viable implementation of smart&amp;nbsp;contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I realised that phase 1 of the Initial Coin Offering (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;) was about to begin, and if I wanted I could acquire the rights to Ãons (the Ãternity token). During phase 1, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; would purchase 1100 Ãons. In early April 2017, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; was worth about&amp;nbsp;Â£38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was willing to make a small and risky investment, but in order to do that I would need to work out how to convert my conventional Sterling into Bitcoin or Ether, in order to then purchase Ãons. The Ãternity website made it super easy to set up an Etherium wallet, and to use that wallet to invest in the Ãternity project, but buying Ether immediately and putting it in my new wallet proved to be&amp;nbsp;challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpfully, the Ãternity project had partnered with the Swiss firm &amp;#8216;Bitcoin Suisse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; who would directly convert to Ãons from fiat currencies, cutting out the need to purchase an intermediate digital currency. However once I&amp;#8217;d completed the identity checks and signed, scanned and sent the multiple forms, I realised I&amp;#8217;d need to pay a &amp;#8216;signing on&amp;#8217; fee of about Â£70. To Bitcoin Suisse&amp;#8217; credit though, they did manually approve my identification and contract within an&amp;nbsp;hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought the project would still be a good investment even with this extra cost, but I determined to exhaust all other possibilities first. I&amp;#8217;m familiar with cryptocurrency wallets and public/private keys due to some &lt;a href="encryption.html"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to immediately begin trying to set up an account with an&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was a fairly chaotic few hours where I would sign-up to several exchanges and see how close I could get to purchasing either Bitcoin or Ether immediately, before realising I either had to wait 48 hours for security clearances, or provide additional details, or wait for manual verification of my scanned identity&amp;nbsp;documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening I had a rough idea of which usernames, passwords and (small) sterling amounts had been submitted to each&amp;nbsp;exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of false starts, I used a combination of the &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; desktop website and their iOS app to purchase &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; up to their weekly limit, and then used multiple cards to increase my holding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;. The Coinbase app would bug out when processing a debit card payment and verifying the card details with the bank. This had initially led me to try other exchanges, where I would hit other roadblocks and delays. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;, for example, doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to make trades in the first 48 hours (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIRC&lt;/span&gt;) after registering, which is reasonable enough unless you&amp;#8217;re in a&amp;nbsp;hurry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had a few Ether to my name, the rest of the process was simple. I was delighted to visit &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/"&gt;Etherscan.io&lt;/a&gt; and view the details of my Etherium - Ãternity transactions almost immediately. This gave me a lot of confidence that I hadn&amp;#8217;t sent money into a void, and was a nice contrast to my (successful) experience buying bitcoin in early&amp;nbsp;2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the simple tool to check your Ã balance at the bottom of Eternity&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://wallet.Ãternity.com"&gt;contribution page&lt;/a&gt; assured me that I&amp;#8217;d made my investment successfully. To me, the Ãternity project stands as an exciting endeavor seeking to solve some widespread and highly valuable technical challenges, I hope they&amp;#8217;re successful and wish them&amp;nbsp;well.    &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Fintech"></category><category term="Finance"></category><category term="Digital Currencies"></category><category term="Blockchains"></category><category term="DLT"></category><category term="Ãternity"></category><category term="ICO"></category></entry><entry><title>Blogging withÂ Pelican</title><link href="pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-28T01:21:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-04-28T01:21:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-04-28:pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I switched to Pelican from Wordpress so that I could design the blog I wanted. Creating a blog in Pelican is a great way to learn &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, Jinja templates and&amp;nbsp;Git.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I began blogging in 2016, I became more aware of how blogs are designed. Many of my favorting blogs had simple designs which made it easier to focus on the content, and they loaded really fast. (E.g.  &lt;a href="https://unwiredcouch.com"&gt;unwiredcouch.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.curiousgnu.com"&gt;CuriousGnu&lt;/a&gt;). I wanted this for my blog, too. I&amp;#8217;d used Wordpress to build and publish my blog which was a great way to begin, but I felt I was compromising on its design and functionality. I wanted to have control over my blog&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to static sites which contain only fixed content and are faster to load and easier to design than one built using a dynamic blogging platform such as Wordpress. Because I was already familiar with Python I chose &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; rather than another static site generator such as&amp;nbsp;Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of sites to tell you how to start blogging in Pelican, so here I will focus on my experience after the initial set-up. When I was learning how to begin, I found &lt;a href="http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html"&gt;Amy Hanlons&lt;/a&gt; blog particularly useful and&amp;nbsp;clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The learning&amp;nbsp;curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¦ was longer than I expected. Since setting out to switch from Wordpress to Pelican, I&amp;#8217;ve taught myself enough of the following tools to hack this site together. I&amp;#8217;m really happy about this because these tools could be used in future projects&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; quirky but intuitive. Tags make sense, comments are laborious and learning by google is relatively quick. Whatever it is I&amp;#8217;m trying to do (like add a link to jump back to the top of the page) someone will have posted the answer&amp;nbsp;somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; feels a lot more concise that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; but it also felt impossible to learn without taking a step back and reading an introductory course. Usually I learn by hacking new phrases together from existing examples so it was frustrating to go backwards before progressing. There was a lightbulb moment when I realised &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; Selectors were a thing, and realising &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; files get called in the header (usually) of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;fileâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using a trial subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/"&gt;Thinkfuls&lt;/a&gt; Front-end developer course, which is pretty good at explaining how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; is structured and how to arrange content on a page. If I still had access, I&amp;#8217;d be completing the second half of the course&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jinja&amp;nbsp;templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jinja is a tool written in Python to create &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look intuitive to me, but I&amp;#8217;ve been able to get enough done by copy-pasting similar snippets from other parts of the theme I started with (&lt;a href="https://github.com/molivier/nest"&gt;Thanks Molivier!&lt;/a&gt;) to make the changes I wanted. I&amp;#8217;d like to learn more as it seems really&amp;nbsp;powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pelican&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a website using Pelican, you need to run commands from the terminal. There are various commands but I found myself using only a few regularly. &amp;#8220;Pelican-quickstart&amp;#8221; will generate a project skeleton to get you started. &amp;#8220;make devserver&amp;#8221; will initialise a local server and generate output files so that I can view changes locally before uploading (its opposite is &amp;#8220;make stopserver&amp;#8221;). Finally &amp;#8220;pelican content -s publishconf.py&amp;#8221; generates the html and css for remote hosting. Some of the plugins I use such as &amp;#8220;Assets&amp;#8221; which minifies the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; only work when publshconf.py is called, which confused me initially as I didn&amp;#8217;t think it was working when I was only using &amp;#8220;make&amp;nbsp;devserver&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really challenged me, and I still don&amp;#8217;t feel like I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing. Git is far more powerful than I need it to be, when all I want to do is undo some erroneous edits and upload a new version of the site to&amp;nbsp;Github. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can stage and commit files, I can create local and remote repo&amp;#8217;s from the command line. I can change a remote&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, reset a repo and force a push or a pull. That&amp;#8217;s all. I haven&amp;#8217;t tried to merge or to create a test branch, and if some part of the process goes wrong it usually takes hours to make it right&amp;nbsp;again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one tool for which the awesome &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SO&lt;/span&gt; and Google cannot magic up the exact right answer immediatly,&amp;nbsp;unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there is still an output folder in the source repo that isâ¦ mysterious to me. Its not the real output, its a version frozen in time from a few weeks ago, and it has an &amp;#8220;@&amp;#8221; in its name. I don&amp;#8217;t know how it got there. It was created one afternoon in a blur of frustrated google queries and copy/paste/hope terminal&amp;nbsp;commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find git&amp;#8217;s commands the least intuitive of all the tools I use, with its preceeding single dashes and double dashes, and random words thrown into the middle of otherwise reasonable&amp;nbsp;commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Git is ubiquitous and Github is awesome, so I will learn&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Github pages with an external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need to add a file called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; to the repo containing the output. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; should contain the address of your site in lowercase.&amp;nbsp;Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll also need to update the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; records of your domain name to point the name at Github&amp;#8217;s servers. For Github, you need two &amp;#8220;A Records&amp;#8221; with host type &amp;#8220;@&amp;#8221; and values &amp;#8220;192.30.252.153&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;192.30.252.154&amp;#8221; respectively. You also need a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; record with host type &amp;#8220;www&amp;#8221; and the value equal to &amp;#8220;username.github.io&amp;#8221;. It took about 12 hours for the changes to propagate, and during that time I had variable success loading the&amp;nbsp;site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;#8217;t want when moving away from Wordpress was a site bloated with features that didn&amp;#8217;t make the content easier to read. However I found I still needed a few plugins to optimise my site and provide some basic functionality that doesn&amp;#8217;t come with the vanilla&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iPython&amp;nbsp;notebooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super useful, as all I need to do to publish a notebook as a webpage is copy the .ipynb file into the context directory and add a sidecar .ipynb-meta file with standard meta data. This functionality is one of the main reasons why Pelican is popular with data bloggers. (Though &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; is another&amp;nbsp;option).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Neighbors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of a post there should be a link to the previous and next blog posts - I was surprised this wasn&amp;#8217;t included as standard. After putting the plugin in the plugins folder and updating pelicanconf.py, you need to copy a couple of jinja snippets into a template, and maybe add some css to make the links look&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimise&amp;nbsp;images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make those images as small as possible to help make the site as fast as possible. Add the plugin, update pelicanconf.py, and thats&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I started working with Pelican, minifying css and JavaScript would have been too advanced. But once &lt;a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/"&gt;Pingdom&lt;/a&gt; and Google &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"&gt;Pagespeed&lt;/a&gt; started criticising me for my multiple .css files, I accepted the&amp;nbsp;challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m super happy wth the websites design and speed. It&amp;#8217;s designed the way I want it, and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt a ton of useful stuff along the&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: My second post about blogging in Pelican is &lt;a href="pelican2.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tools"></category><category term="Pelican"></category><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Static Site"></category></entry><entry><title>Vim!</title><link href="vim.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-01T22:32:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-12-01T22:32:00+01:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-12-01:vim.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vim is a text editor renowned for its efficiency and its use of keyboard shortcuts.

It comes pre-installed on Unix systems (including MacOS) and can be run from the&amp;nbsp;terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim is famous in another way too - for being difficult to learn. I found some good and remarkably creative tools to begin learning its concepts and controls. This was necessary because there is no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;. There is a &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://vim-adventures.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,Â and there is &lt;a href="http://www.openvim.com/"&gt;this interactive tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s also a built-in vim tutorial - just type &amp;#8216;vimtutor&amp;#8217; into&amp;nbsp;Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim is designed so that you don&amp;#8217;t need to take your hands off your keyboard and use a mouse. It has the &amp;#8216;insert&amp;#8217; mode where you enter text as usual, and the &amp;#8216;command&amp;#8217; mode where you can make use of a comprehensive and flexible shortcut language to move around, edit and search the text. With no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; or toolbar, it&amp;#8217;s a very different approach to text editing than I&amp;#8217;m used&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run Vim from the terminal, but there are also versions that run as apps. MacVim on MacOSÂ has the option to show a tool bar of simple commands like a normal program, and lets the arrow keys move the cursor in addition to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;hjkl&amp;#8217; functionality. This makes getting started a little&amp;nbsp;simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a lot of plugins to extend Vim&amp;#8217;s functionality and turn it from a text editor into an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt;Â walks you through setting up Vim as a Python &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; and explains how to manage various&amp;nbsp;add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;html&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt; is a variable (string) which contains a series of folder
locations separated by &amp;#8220;:&amp;#8221;. Each of these folders contains programmes.
When you type the name of a programme into terminal without specifying
its location, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; looks sequentially in each of the folder locations
listed in &lt;html&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt; to see if the programme is there, and then executes&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bin as in Binary, not Bin as in&amp;nbsp;Trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bin folders contain binary files, which are programmes ready to be&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I run &amp;#8220;echo &lt;html&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; from the Terminal, I see 9 folders called bin,
and its only by convention that they contain binaries. They are just
normal folders, which the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; is set to look in when asked to run an&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Spring 2010 untilÂ the Autumn of 2013, I was a PhD candidate living
in Vienna, Austria and working at the University of Natural Resources
and Life Sciences.Â Before working in Vienna, I completed my Masters
degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of&amp;nbsp;Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research quantified the effects of changing the amount of gravity
acting on granular materials as they poured out of a&amp;nbsp;silo.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post containsÂ an overview of my work, as well as links to download
my PhD thesis and the short presentation I used when I defended&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granular materials areÂ a broard class of materials that are
encountered everyday -Â salt, pills, breakfast cereal, sand, rice, soil,
landslides, salt are all granular materials. They are ubiquitous and occur in
many different sizes and&amp;nbsp;varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silos are a common type of container for storing granular materials. You
pour the granular material in from the top, store it for a while, and
then dispense the material in controlled quantities from the&amp;nbsp;bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research&amp;nbsp;focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyÂ research focussed on quantifying how changes in gravity affected the
material contained inside a silo, particularly whilst the silo was being
emptied. This is pertinent because engineers and scientistsÂ do not yet
have a scientific understanding of how granular materials behave. Whilst
gravity clearly affects a granular materials, we cannot say exactly&amp;nbsp;how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we can&amp;#8217;t use analytical methods to quantify the physics that
occur in a real system. Instead we use empirical methods
(approximations, guesses, rules-of-thumb, and knowledge of what worked
in previous similar situations). This isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily bad, but it is
less efficient and less reliable than an analytical&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research&amp;nbsp;techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Physical&amp;nbsp;modelling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a small model silo (30cm tall) and put it into quite a large centrifuge (3 metre diameter). By rotating the model silo around the centre of the centrifuge at a constant speed I could simulate a higher gravity. I added high-speed cameras, pressure sensors and weighing
scales so that I could measureÂ how the material was moving once I opened the silo outlet and the silo began to empty. Photos of the experimental model I built can be seen&amp;nbsp;below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Numerical&amp;nbsp;modelling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also programmedÂ a computer model (using the commercial &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PFC&lt;/span&gt; 3D software
and working in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FISH&lt;/span&gt; scripting language) to simulate and investigate
if the same behaviours could be observed numerically as&amp;nbsp;physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class of computer model I used is known as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEM&lt;/span&gt; (Discrete Element
Modelling). These models work by considering every grain of material individually, usually as a
sphere. If one sphere overlaps with another (i.e. the distance between
the two particle centres is less than the sum of their radiuses) then a
force proportional to the overlap size repels the two spheres away from
each other. This simple approach is repeated over every grain or particle in the model, and produces life like behaviour in many situations. It has many advantages over &amp;#8220;continuum&amp;#8221; based techniques that model groups of grains as if they were all just one big particle with
unusual properties. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEM&lt;/span&gt; has one massive limitation, though. It requires huge amounts of computational resources - and this limits its use in industrial scenarios outside. Until computers become much, much more powerful, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEM&lt;/span&gt; will only be used for theoretical research and niche&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gravity increases by a factor of $x$, both the discharge rate and local velocities within the silo increase by  $\sqrt(x)$&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s good to know if you&amp;#8217;re planning on storing stuff on the moon, but it&amp;#8217;s also a useful step towards explaining exactly why bulk granular materials behave the way they&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with the absolute basics, encryption generally works by taking a message and representing it as a series of numbers &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which are then turned into a series of random looking numbers. Decryption works by turning the random looking numbers back into the original&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historyÂ of Cryptography can be split into classical and modern eras. Modern cryptographyÂ began in 1977 with the introduction of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; and Diffie-Hellman algorithms. Â Until then, Cryptography required using a single key (theÂ secret code) to encrypt and decrypt the message. This was transferred from sender to receiver secretly, but not cryptographically. In classical cryptography, the code is aÂ &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern era removed the requirement for a shared secret and instead used number theory as a basis for quantifying the strength of an encryption method. The strength of a modern cryptographic technique is quantifiable and provable by reference to number theory, rather than a users ability to transport or transfer a secret&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern cryptography is defined by Public Key Cryptographic systems. They use one key (code) for encryption and another for decryption. The encryption key can be made public without any risk of the message being decrypted, and is therefore known as the public key. The key used to decrypt data is the private key, and must not be revealed.Â If a message is encrypted with the public key it can only be decrypted withÂ the private&amp;nbsp;key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Key Cryptographic (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PKC&lt;/span&gt;) systems use algorithms that are easy to process in one direction but difficult to reverse, which are known as mathematical trap-door functions. A simple example of a trap-door function is the product of two prime numbers. If two random prime numbers are chosen, it is trivial to find their product. However if only the product of the two numbers is known, it is relatively difficult to find either of the factors used to create the number (this is factorisation). This was first noticed in 1874, when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons#Jevons.27_number"&gt;Jevons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8,616,460,799?Â I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever&amp;nbsp;know.&amp;#8221;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple problem shows that finding the product of two (secret) prime numbers is computationally simple, but factorising the result is not. This type of problem is a key feature of modern cryptography. Factoring prime numbers is a super famous mathematical problem, it was studied byÂ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes"&gt;Eratosthenes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the 3rd century &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BC&lt;/span&gt; and more recently the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; Factoring Challenge&lt;/a&gt;Â has intended to track state-of-the-art factorisation techniques by issues cash prizes for the factorisation of products of large&amp;nbsp;primes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the bigger the difference in difficulty between executingÂ the function and reversing it, the better the cryptographic&amp;nbsp;technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; algorithm below uses factorisation as the foundation of its security, but factorisation is not the hardest problem to solve relative to the size of the keys required. Algorithms have been developed to factor the products of large prime numbers, and are much more efficient than randomly guessing possible factors. The greater the size of the primes being factored, the more efficient these algorithms become, and therefore the difference in difficulty between executing the function (multiplying two large primes) and reversing it (factorisation) becomes smaller as the size of the cryptographic key length increases. This is a problem because as public key cryptography becomes more commonly used the resources available to factor products of primes increases, and consequently larger keys are&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, encryption techniques based on the difficulty of factorisation will become redundant as the difficulty gap between creating and solving them shrinks. A better trap door function is&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named after its founders (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest" title="Ron Rivest"&gt;Ron Rivest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir" title="Adi Shamir"&gt;Adi Shamir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman" title="Leonard"&gt;Leonard Adleman&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; was one of the first public-key encryption algorithms and is still widely&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; (as well as other cryptographic techniques) makes use of a number line which loops back to zero after reaching a maximum value, rather than increasing indefinitely. This means that once a maximum number $n$Â has been defined, if a number greater than $n$ is created the result simply loops around to 0 and begins counting from 0 again. i.e. if $nÂ = 10$, then $7 + 5 = 12 - 10 = 2$. The result of a calculation on a looping number line may easily be found by doing long division and using the remainder as the final answer, i.e. $12 / 10 = 1$ with $2$&amp;nbsp;remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generation of a pair of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;keys:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Generate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;module&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select two large random prime numbers, $p$Â and $q$. They need to be random because anyone who knows or guesses them will be able to decrypt the&amp;nbsp;encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate $nÂ =&amp;nbsp;pq$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Find derived number&amp;nbsp;(e)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;Â must be greater than 1 and less than $( p - 1)( q -&amp;nbsp;1)$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There must be no common factor for eÂ andÂ $( p - 1)( q - 1)$ except for 1. &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Form the public&amp;nbsp;key&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pair of numbers $(n, e)$ form the public key and can be made&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though $n$ is public, it is so difficult to factor the product of 2 large prime numbers that an attacker would not be able to find its component primes in the time available. The strength of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; rests entirely on the difficulty of factoringÂ $n$Â into its two component prime&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Generate the private key&amp;nbsp;(d)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private key is generated from using $p$, $q$Â andÂ e as inputs to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. For a given set of values, there is a unique answer&amp;nbsp;$d$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$d$Â is the inverse ofÂ $e$ modulo $( p - 1)( q - 1 )$.Â This means that $d$Â is the number less than $( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )$Â such that when it is multiplied byÂ e, it is equal toÂ $1$Â modulo $( p - 1 ) ( q - 1&amp;nbsp;)$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;example:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; does not directly operate on strings as bits, it operates on numbers modulo (less than) $n$. and it isÂ necessary to represent plain text as a series of numbers less than $n$. The dominant encoding on the internet isÂ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8&lt;/a&gt;, which represents each upperÂ case Latin letter as a number between 65 and 90. Using this encoding, a message &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HELLO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; would become &amp;#8220;$72, 69, 76, 76,&amp;nbsp;79$&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum number $n$Â needs to be the product of the two prime numbers $p$ and $q$. For this example choose $p = 7$ and $q = 13$, so $nÂ  = 91$  &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public key componentÂ &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;Â can be any number we choose, Â as long as there is no number other than 1 which is a common factor of &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;Â andÂ $( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )$. In our example, this requires that there be no common factor between 72Â andÂ eÂ other than 1, so let &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; $=&amp;nbsp;5$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore our public key is (91, 5). This can be made available to anyone without messages being decrypted because of the difficulty of factoring the product of (very large) prime&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the fact that we know 5 and 11 are the prime factors of 55 and e is 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm Â to compute our private key $d$, which is&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore when the prime factors 7 and 13 are used, the public key is (91, 5) and the private key is (91, 29). These parameters fully define a functional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encoding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encode a letter H in a message (&amp;#8216;H&amp;#8217; is $72$ in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8), we need to multiply it by itselfÂ $e$ times ($e = 5$), remembering to wrap around each time we pass our maximum value of $n =&amp;nbsp;91$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$72 \times 72 = 5184, 5184 / 91 = 56$ with $88$ remaining, (i.e. $5184 = 91 \times 56 + 88$). Therefore:
$72 \times 72 = 5184 = 88$
$88 \times 72 = 6336 = 57$
$57 \times 72 = 4104 = 9$
$9 \times 72 = 648 =&amp;nbsp;11$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the encrypted value of &amp;#8220;H&amp;#8221; is&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;$11$&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the method for each character in the message &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HELLO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; results in the encoded message&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;\$11,62,20,20,53\$&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To decrypt the message, we take each number and multiply it by itself $d$ times, ($d=29$) wrapping around each time we pass&amp;nbsp;$91$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$11 \times 11 = 121 = 30$
$30 \times 11 = 330 = 57$
&amp;#8230;
$57 \times 11 = 627 = 81$
$81 \times 11 = 891 =&amp;nbsp;72$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re back to our original&amp;nbsp;encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet I used to calculate the encrypted and decrypted values can be downloadedÂ &lt;a href="RSA-Example.xlsx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple python script to encrypt and decrypt a message is &lt;a href="AES_Example.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AES&lt;/span&gt; encryption&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case then eÂ and ( p - 1) ( q - 1 )Â are called &amp;#8220;coprime&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is apparently simple to compute, its description is not.

The Blockchain - the technology which applications like Bitcoin are built on - is significantÂ because it removes the need for trust or an intermediary between unrelated parties transacting with each other.Â So far, the most influential and famous digital currency is&amp;nbsp;Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to introduce the basic concepts of digital currencies and the problems a distributed ledger system needs to&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a digital&amp;nbsp;currency?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital currency is an internet based medium of exchange. Units of digital currency are not printed, are not physical, and represent nothing. A unit of currency is produced by running algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a unit of currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin)Â is&amp;nbsp;generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If the currency represents nothing, why is it&amp;nbsp;valuable?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people believe that in future, other people will believe itÂ does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies) which also don&amp;#8217;t represent anything physical. (Although these examples are Â supported by laws or&amp;nbsp;regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, creatingÂ a new currency without the support of government hasn&amp;#8217;t been practical&amp;nbsp;because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new currency (otherwise people would create counterfeitÂ currency, decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards&amp;nbsp;zero)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An intermediary (a bank) was required for all large or remote transactions, to make sure that the amount of money each party ownsÂ is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventing double spending of&amp;nbsp;funds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technological breakthrough was preventing double spending without requiring an intermediary. This is made possible by using cryptographic techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful computers which have only recently become&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central and distributed&amp;nbsp;ledgers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conventional currencies everyone&amp;#8217;s balance and transactions are recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much moneyÂ each account has) and each account holder only has access to their own balance and transactions. With digital currencies, a copy of the entire ledger (every transaction ever made by everyone) is held on each computer (or node), and anyone can see everyone&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, if two parties wish to make a remote transaction then they need a bank to be the intermediary. The bank mediates by updatingÂ the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds as a result of the transaction. This is how one party knows if the counter-party is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must be involved in every transaction between its account holders. This needÂ for an intermediary increases the complexity and cost of doing&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sending&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in your account should decrease and the amount in another account should increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this message will check its authenticity, make the changes, and pass the message along to other&amp;nbsp;nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What problems does blockchain&amp;nbsp;solve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a transaction to be accepted and entered into the distributed ledger, its authenticity needs to be verified. Because the ledger is distributed, everyone can see everyone else&amp;#8217;s transactions. Therefore user authentication and transaction authorisation needs to be possible without compromising a user&amp;#8217;s ability to send secure payments in&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is neither physical, printed or representative of anything, how do you prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply creating as much new currency as they&amp;nbsp;want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the addition of new transactions to the ledger from many unrelated users. If each partyÂ has their own copy of the ledger, updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers completeness and accuracy be assured?Â How would you update your ledger to take account of transactions between third parties, and how would you know the order in which they occurred?&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The blockchain is remarkable because it is the first technology toÂ solve all of these problems. Future posts will consider each of these problems are&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote it when I began to study for my last set of exams and my mind filled with things I&amp;#8217;d rather be doing instead. Some of these interests are just me reacting to having no spare time for a few months, but others are decent goals and projects. Temporarily losing my spare time made me value it&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free-time" src="/images/spare_time.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this postÂ so that I could compare what I thought was important when I was busy toÂ when I wasn&amp;#8217;t. Writing the list allowed me to move on without forgetting. Here&amp;#8217;s a break down of each&amp;nbsp;item:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Run 10k in 50 minutes&amp;#8221; - This is easier than I imagined. When I wrote the list I could barely run 2k without stopping, but intended to go for a weekly run whilst studying. I&amp;#8217;ve struggled to stay energetic and healthy during previous exam phases, so now I have a rule that I mustÂ do some mild exercise even if I think I can&amp;#8217;t spare the time. I find running really lowers my stress levels, and increasingÂ my heart rate and working up a sweat lets me sleep better
    and concentrate for longer. After a few weeks of minimal running, I could run 5k easily. If I kept at it, 10k in 50 mins would be easy.Â But point&amp;nbsp;2&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Be Insanity strong&amp;#8221; - As in, do the Insanity workout programme. Again. I thought about it and decided to do P90x instead. Week 1 is going&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Read the bible habitually&amp;#8221; - When I was 17 I found out about Jesus and became a Christian. In the months and years after that I&amp;#8217;d regularly read my bible almost every day and pray a lot. I wanted to understand, so I set a goal of 5 chapters each&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read through the new testament repeatedlyÂ and read most of the old testament during this time. I knew the scriptures well enough that a lot of sermons became boring and obvious - I&amp;#8217;d already studiedÂ the bible passage being used. During this time I remember being aware that the way I thought was different to how it would have been otherwise. My perspectives were long-term and less me focused. I thought about what I was reading instead ofÂ the days&amp;#8217; headlines or social chatter. I remember enjoying the benefits and thinking that I should keep this habit. The reasons why I think Christianity is so wonderfulÂ are well summarised in &lt;a href="http://messages.destinyedinburgh.com/sermon/the-gospel-we-preach-a-message-for-leaders"&gt;this sermon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s now 10 years later, and whilst my convictions are strong, my knowledge of the bible is sadly pretty fuzzy. My thinking is clouded by the perspectives contained in the media I consume and the conversations I&amp;#8217;m part of. I strongly suspect I would be acting and
thinking differently if I read my bible more, but I don&amp;#8217;t know what those differences would be. Trouble is, it&amp;#8217;s often not obvious what the immediate benefits of readingÂ the bible are, you have to work for it a bit. Praying for helpÂ is effective.Â The books in the bible were written to last through the ages and across all cultures, so it&amp;#8217;s not surprising that they&amp;#8217;re not as easy to read as something written for an English speaker in a hurry. I should stop being in a hurry, and stop prioritising only quantifiable&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Think more&amp;#8221; - On a similar note to 3, but less supernatural. If I spent less time consuming content and a little more looking around me or walking, I reckon I&amp;#8217;d be more self-aware and make better decisions. This would probably lead to a happier, more satisfying&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Pray more&amp;#8221; - I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but the creator of the universe wants me to talk andÂ share my life with him. He cares about me. This makes no sense to me, at all. If I was God, I would not go out of my way to consider the views and concerns of a very flawed human. But
    when I pray, my prayers are very often answered. I should ask him about&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Amazon seller?&amp;#8221; - Amazon have this &amp;#8220;Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#8221; service,
    which means you don&amp;#8217;t even need to hold the stock you want to sell.
    If I choose the right products, import them cheaply from China and
    reselling Â them on Amazon at a profit, I end up quids in for minimal
    effort and manageable risk. Sounds&amp;nbsp;intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Blog about interesting data&amp;#8221; - Here I am, blogging. I shouldÂ stick
    to the main topicÂ and get technical. I was inspired by this
    &lt;a href="http://www.curiousgnu.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; in&amp;nbsp;particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Finish Coursera&amp;#8221; - The data science specialization is great! It&amp;#8217;s in R, and I want to focus on Python, but I&amp;#8217;d still like to do it. I need to consider the opportunity cost of the time committed,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Read for fun, history, fiction&amp;#8221; - When I started my job, in April 2014, I was half way through &lt;a href="https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;preview=newtab&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4"&gt;Savage Continent&lt;/a&gt;, which is an eye-opening and eye-watering history of Europe in the years after World War 2. I see Europe through different eyes because of it. However I only got half way though, and since April &amp;#8216;14 I never felt I had the free time or energy to pick it back up. This should change. When I was a researcher, and when I was a student, I had so much more opportunity to develop my own pursuits. Since entering the corporate world, I find myself fighting a war of attrition to exert my personality onto my lifestyle. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; Read for fiction&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m unconvinced. What do you have at the end of it? What can you do with it? Maybe I&amp;#8217;ve just been reading the wrong authors, but I&amp;#8217;m going to leave this for now. Sure, you could gainÂ an appreciation of a different time or place, but that appreciation comes via the fictional characters and events, its secondary. What about abstract constructs, perspectives, morals&amp;#8230; things that history books are ill-suited for? Great fiction would be essential for exploring these. But for now, I&amp;#8217;ll prioritise point 3.&lt;/br&gt;  &lt;/br&gt; &lt;iframe style="max-width: 100%; float:middle" src="https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/card?asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;asin=B00796LLLK&amp;amp;preview=inline&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do a photography project&amp;#8221; - This I would love to do, but probably won&amp;#8217;t. It would be a luxury, and the opportunity cost would be too great right now. I&amp;#8217;d like to shoot a series of black and white portraits, and turn them into large prints. I think good portrait photography is uniquely impactful and moving, choosing B&amp;amp;W removes distractions and leaves a subjects humanity more&amp;nbsp;exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Have a list of business/product ideas&amp;#8221; - There&amp;#8217;s no excuse for this
    one, anyone can have several good ideas. It&amp;#8217;s turning them into
    reality that takes skill. Need to have the ideas first,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do a law &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOOC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - i.e Study particular areas of law, in my own time
    and at my own pace. I studied a tiny bit of law during the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt;, and
    realised employment law or contract law could be really useful.
    (Same for the tax system - another surprise).Â We only had a brief
    introduction though, so if I could find the time I&amp;#8217;d like to know&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do an InfoSec or Network SecurityÂ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOOC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - Its super interesting,
    but not likely to be a good use of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Learn to fight - Krav Maga / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - Ever since watching The Bourne
    Identity I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to learn Krav Maga, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LybrzdG96_8"&gt;Georges
    St-Pierre&lt;/a&gt; made me want to train
    forÂ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMA&lt;/span&gt;. For now though, I&amp;#8217;ll do P90x. I can reconsider in 90&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;

Â &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Get out of London&amp;#8221; - My contract ends in April 2017, next summer
    will be a crossroads. I hate the commute, I hate being constantly
    rushed. Living in other cities has been a lot more&amp;nbsp;pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing a few people download the widget was really satisfying, and I was soon wondering what else I could publish.

&lt;p&gt;Seeing a few people download the widget was really satisfying, and I was soon wondering what else I could publish. As a pragmatic engineer, it seemed clear to me what the next widget should do: If my first widget calculated the time since an event, the next should calculate the time until an event. I set out to create the companion to &amp;#8220;Time Since&amp;#8221; and
improve upon the underlying&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first code design choice was to cut out the use of an Apple Script and calculated everything in one CoffeeScript file. It would be more efficient and easier to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I soon began to realise why the original widget I&amp;#8217;dÂ based &amp;#8220;Time Since&amp;#8221; on had used AppleScript to calculate the time elapsed. Date-Times are fiddly to work with in many languages, and this is true in JavaScript&amp;nbsp;also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code began to look increasingly like spaghetti as I tried to achieve 6 key&amp;nbsp;features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the number of months and days between two dates
    (complicated by the varying number of days in different&amp;nbsp;months)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the option to specify the level of detail in the output text (to
    the minute, to the hour, to the day,&amp;nbsp;etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove any 0 amounts from the output (&amp;#8220;2 Months and 5 Hours&amp;#8221; not &amp;#8220;2
    Months, 0 Days and 5&amp;nbsp;Hours&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the option to abbreviate times (&amp;#8216;years&amp;#8217; â &amp;#8216;y&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;hours&amp;#8217; â &amp;#8216;h&amp;#8217;,
    &amp;#8216;and&amp;#8217; â &amp;#8216;&amp;amp;&amp;#8217;,&amp;nbsp;etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output a grammatically correct sentence (correct pluralisation and
    comma separated terms, with an &amp;#8220;and&amp;#8221; between the last two&amp;nbsp;terms)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepend and append users defined&amp;nbsp;strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few frustrating hours, it was clear thatÂ it would be a lot easier to modify the existing AppleScript rather than reinvent the wheel in JavaScript. I decided to use it instead of using only JavaScript as I knew the AppleScript file could correctly consider the number of days in
the months between the 2 dates (feature 1), and it containsÂ a function to pluralise the correct parts of the string (feature&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining features were added by using a combination of if statements and arrays. The if statements simply ask if an amount is equal to zero. If not, then it&amp;#8217;s appended to an array of terms to include in the output. At the end of this code chunk it&amp;#8217;s possible to askÂ how many non-zero terms to include in the output. An array with length one less than the number of output terms is created and filled with commas with an &amp;#8216;and&amp;#8217; in the final&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two arrays are combined in the correct order by looping through the index of the longer array and appending each term to a final array. The final array is the&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#time_until"&gt;Time Until&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt; can be downloaded from the &lt;a href="http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/"&gt;Ãbersicht&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/"&gt;widgets gallery&lt;/a&gt;. I think another useful feature would be an option to specify the output only in terms of a chosen amount, such as weeks or days. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll do that in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Front-end"></category><category term="AppleScript"></category><category term="CoffeeScript"></category><category term="JavaScript"></category><category term="Time Until"></category><category term="Ãbersicht"></category><category term="Widgets"></category></entry><entry><title>How to wake upÂ early</title><link href="how-to-wake-up-early.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-06T22:04:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-08-06T22:04:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-08-06:how-to-wake-up-early.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For years I&amp;#8217;ve wished that I could wake up early and use the quiet

&lt;p&gt;Become a&amp;nbsp;parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You will be well-practiced at quickly waking up at previously
    unthinkable&amp;nbsp;times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be used to operating on less sleep than you ever thought&amp;nbsp;possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your beautiful child will become a reliable alarm clock, waking you
    up at the crack of dawn with cute smiles and increasingly insistent
    demands that you get up, play and make&amp;nbsp;breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the freedom to begin sleeping and working when you want, I still believe this is a great option.

(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;, Python) is debugging, and working out exactly where in the
chain of individual commands something unexpected happened. Even with
only a modest page of code, I can quickly find myself rerunning the
entire script multiple times and commenting-out and uncommenting
multiple lines in order to understand what&amp;#8217;s really going on. If you
have a time consuming task at the start of your script, such as a
summarise and sort command, the extra time required can be even greater.
This leads to interrupted flow and&amp;nbsp;concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandas is a python package to manipulate large datasets, the Jupyter
notebook is an application which allows the user to run a python script
in chunks, and output the results of each chunk before continuing. You
can re-run a previous chunk without returning to the beginning, and
change the code as you go along. This is amazingly flexible and&amp;nbsp;intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently worked through an exceptionally good Pandas tutorial recorded
at PyCon 2015. &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw"&gt;Pandas from the ground
up&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; is well structured, clear, has good
scope and the resources are available to download from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Some googling brought me to Coursera, and the &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science"&gt;Data Science
Specialisation&lt;/a&gt;
run by Johns Hopkins University. Â It consists of 9 courses, and so far
I&amp;#8217;ve completed five. If you do the courses in order then prior knowledge
isn&amp;#8217;t required, and I think the courses strike a good balance of brevity
and&amp;nbsp;depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main downside to me is that the courses exclusively use R (which is
popular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more
popular in&amp;nbsp;Industry).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data
science, such as statistical inference or machine learning. Key concepts
and tools in each subject are explained and developed, and whilst it&amp;#8217;s
not as thorough as a longer course would be, there is more than enough
material packed into the lectures, quizzes, assignments and projects to
applyÂ to real&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve read that the second half of the specialisation is a lot more
technical than the first, so I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to setting aside some
time, working through the assignments and acquiring some useful&amp;nbsp;skills!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="Coursera"></category><category term="Data Science"></category><category term="R"></category></entry><entry><title>Ãbersicht widget: TimeÂ Since</title><link href="ubersicht-widget-time-since.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-30T13:29:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-07-30T13:29:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-07-30:ubersicht-widget-time-since.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/"&gt;Ãbersicht&lt;/a&gt; is a desktop widgets app for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X.

to download and play with. A widget is a small app or feature that
embeds into the desktop and displays some simple information. It can
tell you what song is currently playing, a weather forecast, disk space
remaining, etc. The widgets are written in CoffeeScript, which is a
variant of&amp;nbsp;JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using Ãbersicht I began playing with the widgets,
changing their appearance and their position on the screen. Some of the
widgets are too complicated to mess with without specific programming
knowledge, but others are surprisinglyÂ simple and&amp;nbsp;intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By trial and error, I began to customize widgets to my preferences. One
widget I wanted to have but couldn&amp;#8217;t simply download was a timer to tell
me exactly how much time had elapsed since a specific past&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combiningÂ the display attributes of one widget and the calculation
method of another, I was able to mash together a foundation for a new
widget. I then added some extra features&amp;nbsp;including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional text before and after the elapsed&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice of expanded or abbreviated display&amp;nbsp;styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible formatting to remove and zero&amp;nbsp;amounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget is called &lt;a href="http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#time_since"&gt;&amp;#8220;Time Since&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and is in
