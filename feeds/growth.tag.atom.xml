I&amp;#8217;m trying to change&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since April I&amp;#8217;ve been able to work full time as a solo founder. I&amp;#8217;ve challenged myself to build something useful enough that customers would want to
pay for it and in the process of seeking that goal I&amp;#8217;ve become a much better
and more rounded&amp;nbsp;developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working solo for about 7 months now, and in that time I&amp;#8217;ve begun
using test driven development, I&amp;#8217;ve built non-trivial data driven web apps
using Django, and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt how to deploy and monitor those apps in
production and make them&amp;nbsp;performant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made two main apps; &lt;a href="https://moneybar.nl"&gt;moneybar.nl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pippip.email"&gt;pippip.email&lt;/a&gt;,
and I&amp;#8217;ve learnt so&amp;nbsp;much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m realising though, that I still have much to learn in other spheres. Being a
great developer is deeply meaningful to me. It&amp;#8217;s literally a bucket list item
for me and I intend to be writing code as long as I live. But there is no point creating products if no one knows they&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where marketing and positioning comes in. Right now it feels like I know nothing about how to get
users, or validate an idea, or position a product. These are all super necessary and super&amp;nbsp;unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more meta level, I&amp;#8217;m confronted with the lost benefits of working with co-foudners, or of having friends doing similar things. I want to work faster and
make progress more efficiently. I need to be part of a&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in isolation does have its advantages, though. I&amp;#8217;m self-taught and
self-directed, figuring out the contours of uncharted territory and creating my own
personal map. In my mind, I have a deep and almost personal relationship with the coding
abstractions and tools I&amp;#8217;ve learnt to work with. Classes and functions, strings and
floats, literally have (to me) their own textures, colors and weights when I
think or dream about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like I can pick up these abstractions as if they were
physical objects and turn them around to examine them. Place them next to each
other and compare the differences. Run thought experiements. In my experience,
this kind of relationship and affection simply doesn&amp;#8217;t happen when taking a
class or following someone elses schedule.
It&amp;#8217;s satisying to feel ownership of a skill like this, and it&amp;#8217;s one of the
primary reasons I consider coding to be similar to a&amp;nbsp;craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, now that I realise I need to validate my product,
position it, and figure out marketing, I&amp;#8217;ve stopped writing code, put down my
tools, and I&amp;#8217;m going to learn marketing. I&amp;#8217;ve bought some books. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll post some reviews here&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no particular order here is what I plan to&amp;nbsp;read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;ve covered 90% of the distance required or 50%. It&amp;#8217;s
exhausting but I&amp;#8217;m here for the journey not the&amp;nbsp;destination.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="marketing"></category><category term="growth"></category></entry></feed>
