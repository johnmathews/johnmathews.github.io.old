Historically, the safest asset you can buy has been gold. This is not because of anything inherently special about gold, but because that is what people believe to be the best long term method of storing&amp;nbsp;value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People believe gold is special because they assume that in future other people will believe it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Criteria for a safe haven&amp;nbsp;asset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safe-haven asset must fulfil the following&amp;nbsp;criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price isn&amp;#8217;t controlled by any single party, including a state or bank. The market is spread out beyond the reach of any one organisation. This is important because an asset which is issued, controlled or backed by an organisation has its value tied to the health of that&amp;nbsp;organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply isn&amp;#8217;t controlled by any single party, including a state, bank or anyone else - it exists naturally and the rate at which it&amp;#8217;s produced or traded is beyond the control of any one&amp;nbsp;organisation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply is limited. The effort required to create the asset naturally limits the&amp;nbsp;supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The asset doesn&amp;#8217;t wear out or&amp;nbsp;expire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s prohibitively expensive to&amp;nbsp;fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost everyone considers it to be precious and&amp;nbsp;valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be stored and transported simply. It&amp;#8217;s not delicate or&amp;nbsp;volatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, and because of historical consensus, people have been happy to use gold as a store of value in times of economic uncertainty or for long durations. Other assets also meets these requirements to lesser&amp;nbsp;extents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin compared to&amp;nbsp;gold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider why gold is so good as a safe haven asset and long term value store. For all the reasons above, bitcoin is better, except one: At present, not many people consider it to be precious and valuable, so the market is small. This will change as confidence and awareness increases, and the eco-system of services and applications&amp;nbsp;matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamentals are already&amp;nbsp;established:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decentralised network ensures that Bitcoin can&amp;#8217;t be regulated or controlled by a single government or organisation. The network can&amp;#8217;t be turned off or&amp;nbsp;controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The present and future rate of supply is publicly available and inviolable. This increases market efficiency and creates more rational pricing than a market where the rate of supply is&amp;nbsp;unverifiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply is naturally (mathematically) limited using proof of work&amp;nbsp;algorithms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin doesn&amp;#8217;t corrode or wear&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is impossible to&amp;nbsp;fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin can be stored and transported more easily than gold. - If you can remember 24 words you can transport all your bitcoin effortlessly where ever you&amp;nbsp;go. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.runtogold.com/the-great-bitcoin-bull-market-of-2017/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, published a week after I wrote this post, looks at different factors to consider when evaluating Bitcoin&amp;#8217;s value. It goes into a lot of detail, relative to what I&amp;#8217;ve seen in other&amp;nbsp;articles. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="bitcoin"></category><category term="gold"></category><category term="safe haven"></category></entry></feed>
