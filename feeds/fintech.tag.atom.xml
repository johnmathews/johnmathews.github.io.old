Here they are, I hope these instructions are useful for someone looking to get&amp;nbsp;started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in order to deploy a wallet. There are several apps that you can use. I&amp;#8217;ve used Parity because I found it simple and&amp;nbsp;quick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethereum&amp;nbsp;Wallets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallets are a type of contract and there are two types of wallet, the Multi-Sig wallet and the Watch wallet. An Ethereum account is required to communicate with a contract so if you want a multi-sig wallet with 3 signatories (for example) then you will need to have set up at least 1 of those 3 Ethereum accounts before creating the&amp;nbsp;wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their&amp;nbsp;website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrated directly into your Web browser, Parity is the fastest and most secure way of interacting with the Ethereum&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do a bunch of stuff with Parity including mining Ether, manage accounts, interact with different dapps, send/receive from different accounts, and set up contracts. On the accounts tab, you can quickly set up Multi-Signature wallets. If you use the Chrome plugin you will also get handy notifications when transactions are confirmed or contracts&amp;nbsp;deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download and open&amp;nbsp;Parity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For MacOS you can download and install Parity by visiting the Parity site and downloading the &lt;a href="https://parity.io/parity.html"&gt;installer&lt;/a&gt;, or from the terminal using curl or&amp;nbsp;Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple&amp;nbsp;option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   $ bash &amp;lt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;curl https://get.parity.io -kL&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed instructions are &lt;a href="https://github.com/paritytech/homebrew-paritytech"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   brew tap paritytech/paritytech
   brew install parity --stable
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you used the installer, then you open Parity opening the app and then using the logo in the&amp;nbsp;menubar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used Brew, then start Parity with the following&amp;nbsp;command &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then go to the following address in your&amp;nbsp;browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8180/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see something similar to&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity home screen view" src="images/parity-home.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add or create&amp;nbsp;accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity toolbar" src="images/Parity-toolbar-accounts.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity toolbar" src="images/parity-account-creation.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the Accounts tab from the top of the page and then select &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;+ Account&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;. Either create new accounts or import them using your preferred method. You don&amp;#8217;t need to import all the accounts that will be part of the multi-sig wallet, but you will need to import or create the account that will own the wallet you are about to create. This account will need to have a large enough Ether balance to pay the transaction costs to deploy the multi-sig wallet onto the Blockchain. The costs are tiny, but they are greater than&amp;nbsp;zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parity toolbar" src="images/Parity-toolbar-wallet.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-wallet-details.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve either created or imported the account which will deploy the wallet, select &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;+ Wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; from the accounts tab and choose &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Sig wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;. Click&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter a &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; for the wallet, if you want you can add a local &lt;strong&gt;description&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;From account&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; will be the contract owner and this account&amp;nbsp;will &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be one of the&amp;nbsp;signatories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to have enough Ether to pay for the execution of the contract on the&amp;nbsp;blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the &amp;#8220;+&amp;#8221; button under &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Other wallet owners&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; to add the address of the other signatory accounts. You&amp;#8217;ll need to add one line for each signatory and these accounts will also own the wallet once it is&amp;nbsp;deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;required owners&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; section, specify how many accounts will need to approve a transaction that is above the daily transaction&amp;nbsp;limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;wallet day limit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; to set how much Ether can be spent by each account per day &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; needing another account to approve the transaction. Set an amount of 0 if you want all transactions to require approval, or turn the option off using the slider to the right (which just specifies a huge&amp;nbsp;number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;#8220;next&amp;#8221; and you&amp;#8217;ll be shown a pop-up window to approve the creation of the wallet. You will need to enter the password of the account which is creating the wallet, and once you click &amp;#8220;Confirm request&amp;#8221; the funds in the creators accounts will be used to deploy the contract on chain and create the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-conf-box.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding an existing multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your wallet is created and deployed, you&amp;#8217;ll need to add it to other parity clients so that the other signatories can make or confirm transactions, and view the wallets balance. This is done by adding a watch&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process: Accounts tab &amp;gt; + Wallet &amp;gt; Watch wallet &amp;gt; enter the address of the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other signatories will now be able to view the wallet&amp;#8217;s balance, get notifications about pending confirmations, and be able to make and monitor&amp;nbsp;transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing a multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can put funds into the wallet, just like a normal account. Just send Ether to the wallet&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="select multisig wallet" src="images/parity-select-multisig.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="select multisig wallet" src="images/new-parity-wallet.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the page you click &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; to change the local name and description of the&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; allows you add or remove owners (signatories) of the wallet and change the required number of approvals and the wallet day limit. If you change these settings then the changes will need to be executed on the blockchain and the account requesting the change will therefore need to pay the required funds. Depending on the settings being changed, other accounts will need to approve the changes before they are&amp;nbsp;implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; will remove the multi-sig wallet from your accounts&amp;nbsp;tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving funds out of a multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; in the wallet management window (pictured above) to begin withdrawing funds from the&amp;nbsp;wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the token you want to transfer - Ethereum is the only default&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sender address&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; - specify which account wants to withdraw the funds from the multi-sig&amp;nbsp;wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipient address&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; - specify which account will receive the&amp;nbsp;funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount to transfer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; - specify how much you want to transfer. If the amount is greater than the remaining daily limit you will get a warning bar telling you the transaction will require confirmation from other wallet&amp;nbsp;owners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to specify the maximum transaction fee (a payment with a lower fee will be confirmed more slowly than usual) tick the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;advanced sending options&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicking &amp;#8220;send&amp;#8221; will bring you to the confirmation stage where you can enter the password for the account which is requesting the&amp;nbsp;transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If approval from other wallet owners is required and they are also using Parity, then they can see that their approval is required in two ways:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The signer tab will show there is a pending request.
    &lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-signer-alert.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wallet management window (accessed from the accounts tab) has a &amp;#8220;pending transactions&amp;#8221; section where any confirmation requests will be shown.
   &lt;img alt="Wallet management" src="images/parity-wallet-management.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

One of the best sessions was with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;#8220;Understand Investment&amp;#8221;. These are my&amp;nbsp;notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are seeking to identify high-potential startups, and then support and fund&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are looking for something that is innovative and&amp;nbsp;unproven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A startup is not a company but an organisation searching for a business&amp;nbsp;model,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whilst executing and discovering a scalable way to&amp;nbsp;grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups need money for ambitious but credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical stake for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; could be roughly&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s want an exit price of at least 100m, otherwise their business models don&amp;#8217;t work&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10m can seem a lot for a founder with a 30% stake, but it&amp;#8217;s not enough to attract VCs, so aim&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&amp;nbsp;pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify specific people with real&amp;nbsp;needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size of&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your clear competitive advantage - why can no-one else do&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a large and attractive&amp;nbsp;marketâ¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a smart, skilled and cohesive&amp;nbsp;team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a strong ability to deliver quickly and to learn&amp;nbsp;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is ready to go big whatever it&amp;nbsp;takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a unique vision and&amp;nbsp;project-fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuable and differentiated&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient go-to-market and growth&amp;nbsp;channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable monetisation&amp;nbsp;strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability and&amp;nbsp;defensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show traction and that you&amp;#8217;ve cracked the important&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show ambitous and credible growth&amp;nbsp;plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a capital-efficient growth&amp;nbsp;model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a clear strategy to scale and&amp;nbsp;win&lt;/li&gt;

Learn to leverage your time, you can never get it back. Being a successful founder is not impossible, it is always&amp;nbsp;exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whilst at the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; I went to a session called &amp;#8220;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve written generally about the summit &lt;a href="lis17.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oussama spoke with passion and humour. It&amp;#8217;s clear that he cares about encouraging would-be founders and confronting some of the cultural hurdles that exist in Europe. These are my notes from the&amp;nbsp;session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are serious about building something that matters then you have a great and exciting future&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can never predict who will be successful and who will fail. There are a lot of dumb successful people and clever founders can&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really important to learn how to leverage your time effectively. You can lose anything else and get it back but you can never recover the time you&amp;#8217;ve already&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to succeed is to try&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to do something that&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe you need to be more ambitious than average (measured against other countries) because the environment makes it harder to be an entrepreneur. (Attitudes to risk, comfort, security, expectations of failure.. are all unhelpful for&amp;nbsp;founders.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not impossible, just harder. So be more&amp;nbsp;ambitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is replaceable, no-one is&amp;nbsp;unique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can always lose money and replace it. There is so much money in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at Crunchbase and see the failure rate for companies that raised $1m - $10m, it is the same rate for those that raised&amp;nbsp;$10m+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you lose money on a project you will learn things from that experience and you can leverage that&amp;nbsp;learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;â¦ But you will never get back the time you&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zombies are companies that make enough money to survive but not enough to provide joy to the people in the company - aim high&amp;nbsp;andâ¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a company is a big deal, like starting a marriage. Think hard about what you will be doing, what problem you are trying to solve, who you will be working&amp;nbsp;with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Europe there is not enough money to go around and this makes pitching hard. Silicon Valley doesn&amp;#8217;t have this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average a startup in Europe will raise less than a startup in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe is irrationally concerned about risk. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is less concerned with risk and this is very&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So be pragmatic about&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate in London where the laws are good, even if you don&amp;#8217;t want to operate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. It has a better designed system of corporate law. Estonia is also&amp;nbsp;good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best European city for&amp;nbsp;founders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London, Paris,&amp;nbsp;Berlin..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a best city because none are&amp;nbsp;holistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London has the&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paris has engineering and product development (and no-one outside Paris knows the products&amp;nbsp;exist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin has automation and execution, execution and&amp;nbsp;scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â¦You need to draw on all 3 of these cities, which when taken together can surpass Silicon&amp;nbsp;Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anecdotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of Slack lives in Vancouver with his wife and kids. He spends 1 day each week in California and everyone thinks Slack is Californian due to good marketing. Forget national pride, be pragmatic. Leverage the&amp;nbsp;internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of Airbnb would fly from New York to California for 1 day each week. They were originally in California where AirBnB started, but decided that if they could make it work in New York then AirBnB would be a success, so they moved to New York and flew back for meetings , etc. If you ask Europeans to come to a meeting in London (which is not as far as California is from New York) people start complaining and deciding they can&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;bothered. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="LIS"></category><category term="Startup"></category><category term="FinTech"></category><category term="Europe"></category></entry><entry><title>The Lisbon InvestmentÂ Summit</title><link href="lis17.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-06-09T17:53:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-06-09:lis17.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Lisbon investment Summit was full of Investors as well as Founders. The sessions were good enough but the real value was in the&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.lis-summit.com/"&gt;Lisbon Investment Summit&lt;/a&gt; on June 6 and 7 as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; InsurTech startup team with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jd_sullivan?lang=en-gb"&gt;John Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first startup conference I&amp;#8217;d been to and I arrived hoping to have some useful conversations and understand more about the Fintech and startup spaces in Europe. As usual I wanted to focus on tech, finance and&amp;nbsp;blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who was&amp;nbsp;there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as some outstanding sessions there was a high ratio of investors to startups. This made talking to VCs, bankers and M&amp;amp;A lawyers really easy. I was happy to meet a London-based and Fintech-focussed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; when I sat down to have lunch, and thanks to interrupting a session to ask blockchain related questions on Day 1, a banker struck up a conversation with me over breakfast the next day. I met a lot of people across many relevant roles, and once I&amp;#8217;ve worked through my notes and my new collection of business cards I hope to have some great follow-up&amp;nbsp;meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useful&amp;nbsp;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most useful sessions for me&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="ambitious.html"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en"&gt;Oussama Ammar&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thefamily.co"&gt;TheFamily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="investment.html"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Understanding Investment&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden"&gt;Boris Golden&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.partechventures.com"&gt;Partech&amp;nbsp;Ventures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Building successful businesses on blockchain technologies&amp;#8221; a panel discussion moderated by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kloaec?lang=en"&gt;Kevin Loaec&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="http://chainsmiths.com/"&gt;Chainsmiths&lt;/a&gt; blockchain consultancy, and including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mir_btc"&gt;Mir Serena Liponi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.blockchainlab.it/"&gt;Blockchain&amp;nbsp;Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain session was valuable because it&amp;#8217;s unusual to meet people who have been working in the blockchain space for several years. I&amp;#8217;m always wary of being distracted by the hype and noise around developments in the blockchain space so I appreciated hearing some informed and level-headed&amp;nbsp;opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political&amp;nbsp;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening session included a speech from the Mayor of Lisbon and the next day opened with a speech from the Secretary of Industry. Both speeches conveyed an open and progressive attitude to international cooperation aimed at promoting and supporting founders and startups in Portugal. The warm words were supported by practical measures including tax incentives and a state-backed scheme to match amounts contributed by private investors. It was really refreshing to hear a politician extol the virtues of multinational cooperation and bringing different cultures into Portugal. I wish Britain could do this&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Brexit, which inevitably arose due to London&amp;#8217;s present role as a centre of finance and innovation, it seems Europe is still expecting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; to come to its senses, and cannot understand why it&amp;#8217;s destroying its goodwill and reputation so&amp;nbsp;thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two days in Lisbon were full of useful and energetic conversations and it was a great experience pitching &lt;a href="http://www.oula.la"&gt;Oula.la&lt;/a&gt; multiple times and talking about what we&amp;#8217;re trying to do and how blockchains are a part of that. The opportunities to meet founders and investors are invaluable for making informed decisions. Lisbon is a beautiful city which I found easy to get around and always felt safe in. It&amp;#8217;s also refreshingly &lt;a href="london.html"&gt;affordable!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I tried several exchanges and chose the quickest, cheapest conversion&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On April 3rd, I happened to be Googling digital currencies and blockchain innovations when I came across the &lt;a href="http://www.Ãternity.com"&gt;Ãternity website&lt;/a&gt; and skimmed their &lt;a href="https://blockchain.Ãternity.com/%C3%A6ternity-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;. The project is ambitious, like many crypto projects, but seems well organised. The team is well known in the space. There is a clear plan to develop the project and create a blockchain technology that, if successful, could bring. A step change in the use of digital currencies for high volume low value transactions, and the viable implementation of smart&amp;nbsp;contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I realised that phase 1 of the Initial Coin Offering (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;) was about to begin, and if I wanted I could acquire the rights to Ãons (the Ãternity token). During phase 1, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; would purchase 1100 Ãons. In early April 2017, 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; was worth about&amp;nbsp;Â£38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was willing to make a small and risky investment, but in order to do that I would need to work out how to convert my conventional Sterling into Bitcoin or Ether, in order to then purchase Ãons. The Ãternity website made it super easy to set up an Etherium wallet, and to use that wallet to invest in the Ãternity project, but buying Ether immediately and putting it in my new wallet proved to be&amp;nbsp;challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpfully, the Ãternity project had partnered with the Swiss firm &amp;#8216;Bitcoin Suisse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; who would directly convert to Ãons from fiat currencies, cutting out the need to purchase an intermediate digital currency. However once I&amp;#8217;d completed the identity checks and signed, scanned and sent the multiple forms, I realised I&amp;#8217;d need to pay a &amp;#8216;signing on&amp;#8217; fee of about Â£70. To Bitcoin Suisse&amp;#8217; credit though, they did manually approve my identification and contract within an&amp;nbsp;hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought the project would still be a good investment even with this extra cost, but I determined to exhaust all other possibilities first. I&amp;#8217;m familiar with cryptocurrency wallets and public/private keys due to some &lt;a href="encryption.html"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to immediately begin trying to set up an account with an&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was a fairly chaotic few hours where I would sign-up to several exchanges and see how close I could get to purchasing either Bitcoin or Ether immediately, before realising I either had to wait 48 hours for security clearances, or provide additional details, or wait for manual verification of my scanned identity&amp;nbsp;documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening I had a rough idea of which usernames, passwords and (small) sterling amounts had been submitted to each&amp;nbsp;exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of false starts, I used a combination of the &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; desktop website and their iOS app to purchase &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt; up to their weekly limit, and then used multiple cards to increase my holding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;. The Coinbase app would bug out when processing a debit card payment and verifying the card details with the bank. This had initially led me to try other exchanges, where I would hit other roadblocks and delays. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;, for example, doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to make trades in the first 48 hours (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIRC&lt;/span&gt;) after registering, which is reasonable enough unless you&amp;#8217;re in a&amp;nbsp;hurry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had a few Ether to my name, the rest of the process was simple. I was delighted to visit &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/"&gt;Etherscan.io&lt;/a&gt; and view the details of my Etherium - Ãternity transactions almost immediately. This gave me a lot of confidence that I hadn&amp;#8217;t sent money into a void, and was a nice contrast to my (successful) experience buying bitcoin in early&amp;nbsp;2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the simple tool to check your Ã balance at the bottom of Eternity&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://wallet.Ãternity.com"&gt;contribution page&lt;/a&gt; assured me that I&amp;#8217;d made my investment successfully. To me, the Ãternity project stands as an exciting endeavor seeking to solve some widespread and highly valuable technical challenges, I hope they&amp;#8217;re successful and wish them&amp;nbsp;well.    &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Disintermediation"></category><category term="Fintech"></category><category term="Finance"></category><category term="Digital Currencies"></category><category term="Blockchains"></category><category term="DLT"></category><category term="Ãternity"></category><category term="ICO"></category></entry><entry><title>Digital currencies: theÂ basics</title><link href="digital-currencies-the-basics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-19T21:02:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-08-19T21:02:00+02:00</updated><author><name>John Mathews</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-08-19:digital-currencies-the-basics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Digital currencies are often discussedÂ in the context of finance, technology and economics.

The Blockchain - the technology which applications like Bitcoin are built on - is significantÂ because it removes the need for trust or an intermediary between unrelated parties transacting with each other.Â So far, the most influential and famous digital currency is&amp;nbsp;Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to introduce the basic concepts of digital currencies and the problems a distributed ledger system needs to&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a digital&amp;nbsp;currency?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital currency is an internet based medium of exchange. Units of digital currency are not printed, are not physical, and represent nothing. A unit of currency is produced by running algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a unit of currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin)Â is&amp;nbsp;generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If the currency represents nothing, why is it&amp;nbsp;valuable?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people believe that in future, other people will believe itÂ does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies) which also don&amp;#8217;t represent anything physical. (Although these examples are Â supported by laws or&amp;nbsp;regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, creatingÂ a new currency without the support of government hasn&amp;#8217;t been practical&amp;nbsp;because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new currency (otherwise people would create counterfeitÂ currency, decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards&amp;nbsp;zero)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An intermediary (a bank) was required for all large or remote transactions, to make sure that the amount of money each party ownsÂ is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventing double spending of&amp;nbsp;funds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technological breakthrough was preventing double spending without requiring an intermediary. This is made possible by using cryptographic techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful computers which have only recently become&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central and distributed&amp;nbsp;ledgers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conventional currencies everyone&amp;#8217;s balance and transactions are recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much moneyÂ each account has) and each account holder only has access to their own balance and transactions. With digital currencies, a copy of the entire ledger (every transaction ever made by everyone) is held on each computer (or node), and anyone can see everyone&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, if two parties wish to make a remote transaction then they need a bank to be the intermediary. The bank mediates by updatingÂ the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds as a result of the transaction. This is how one party knows if the counter-party is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must be involved in every transaction between its account holders. This needÂ for an intermediary increases the complexity and cost of doing&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sending&amp;nbsp;money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in your account should decrease and the amount in another account should increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this message will check its authenticity, make the changes, and pass the message along to other&amp;nbsp;nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What problems does blockchain&amp;nbsp;solve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a transaction to be accepted and entered into the distributed ledger, its authenticity needs to be verified. Because the ledger is distributed, everyone can see everyone else&amp;#8217;s transactions. Therefore user authentication and transaction authorisation needs to be possible without compromising a user&amp;#8217;s ability to send secure payments in&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is neither physical, printed or representative of anything, how do you prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply creating as much new currency as they&amp;nbsp;want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the addition of new transactions to the ledger from many unrelated users. If each partyÂ has their own copy of the ledger, updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers completeness and accuracy be assured?Â How would you update your ledger to take account of transactions between third parties, and how would you know the order in which they occurred?&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The blockchain is remarkable because it is the first technology toÂ solve all of these problems. Future posts will consider each of these problems are&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Byzantine Generals problem, which is nicely described in the introduction of 
&lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
