<h1 id="premise">Premise</h1>
<ol>
<li>People want to <strong>survive and thrive</strong>. They are their own protagonist and they
   have problems. They don’t want to waste energy figuring out if you can help them.</li>
<li>Good marketing makes the <strong>benefit obvious</strong>. How does your product improve
   someones ability to “survive and thrive”?</li>
<li>Cut through noisy and challenging world by having a super <strong>quick and easy to
   understand message</strong>. Don’t be clever, be clear. Don’t make the customer spend
   calories trying to figure out how they will benefit from your product.</li>
<li>Stories are a great way to combat noise and get the attention because they
   organise information in an intuitive way. People are compelled to <strong>pay
   attention until all the “story gaps” have been closed</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Could a caveman look at your website and answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you <strong>offer</strong>?</li>
<li>How will it <strong>improve</strong> my life?</li>
<li>What are the <strong>next steps</strong>?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Story Gaps</h3>
<ul>
<li>A gap between a character and what they want. Will they find their way to success, overcome their challenges, etc.</li>
<li>Cadence and momentum are defined by the creation and fulfillment of story gaps.</li>
<li>If you fail to define something that the customer wants, you fail to open a story gap.</li>
<li>This makes the story uninteresting because there isn’t a question that requires an answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Story gaps work because we want things to resolve. It’s like singing twinkle
twinkle little star but stopping before the “are” on the last line. You need to
hear the last note of the melody for the tune to feel complete.</p>
<p>Pare down the customers desire to a single focus. Make your brand known for
single specific desire and helping people get it.</p>
<p>Don’t clutter the story by diluting the hero’s desire with other desires. You
can eventually develop subplots.</p>
<h3>Apple</h3>
<p>When Apple released the Lisa computer in 1983, Jobs bought a 9 page ad in the
New York times listing the computers features. When jobs returned to Apple
after being fired, (and after partly founding Pixar, which tells stories) apple
became a customer centric company, and their marketing was about the customers.
9 pages became 2 words - “think different”. A message about their customers, and
their customers need to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Apple isn’t the hero in the “think different” brand. The customer is. It’s the
same with Nike. Apple plays a role more like Q in James Bond, giving the hero
what they need to win.</p>

<h1 id="hero">Hero</h1>
<p>The customer, not you. You are the guide. The customer is the main character in
their life and is battling internal and external adversity it order to survive
and thrive. Heroes have weaknesses, the guide is usually the strongest character.</p>
<p>A story starts with a character who wants to  overcome external challenges that
pose internal and philosophical problems.</p>
<p>Your first task is to create the story gap “Will they get what they want?” You
need to define the characters ambition in the opening section, so that the
reader knows what is at stake and what kind of a story it is.</p>
<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>If you identify a customers problem then you show that you understand them. This
is a hook into the story because they relate to your narrative.</p>
<p>The more we talk about the problems our customers are experiencing, the more
interest they will have in our brand.</p>
<p>Every story needs a villain, which is the personified problem. The germs are
personified, envy is personified, etc. The diminished social status is
personified by someone with more status being villainized.</p>
<p>The <strong>villain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>should be <strong>relatable</strong> - readers should recognize that the villain should be disdained.</li>
<li>should be a <strong>root source</strong> - frustration is what the villain makes us feel. High taxes are the cause, and are therefore the villain.</li>
<li>should be <strong>singular</strong> - just one villain, keep it simple to cut through the noise.</li>
<li>should be <strong>real</strong> - don’t be a fear monger. Fight a real problem on behalf of your customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of <strong>problem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>External</strong> - A barrier to stability that must be removed - My business isn’t growing fast enough, profits are too small.</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - I have self-doubt. Do I have what it takes to succeed?</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical</strong> - I deserve to be successful, my hard work should be rewarded. Failure would be unjust.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>villain</strong> initiates an <strong>external</strong> problem that causes the <strong>hero</strong> to encounter an <strong>internal</strong> problem that is <strong>philosophically wrong</strong> or unjust.</p>
<p>The purpose of the (story specific) external problem is to manifest the (relatable by the audience) internal problem.</p>
<p>Customers are much more motivated to solve internal problems than they are external.</p>
<p>Choose a <strong>desire relevant to their survival</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conserving or accumulating resources (financial or time)</li>
<li>Gaining status or building a social network</li>
<li>Being generous - Most people are not as Darwinian as we’ve been led to believe they want to be empathetic and caring</li>
<li>The desire for meaning - Give customers an opportunity to be generous and participate in something greater than themselves (“the chief desire of man is not pleasure, but meaning”).</li>
</ol>
<p>Translate the <strong>external problem</strong> into several survival categories - put your solution in
the context of a type of survival they they want. Otherwise there isn’t a story gap.</p>
<p>The only reason that customers buy is because the external problem being solved
is causing an <strong>internal frustration</strong>. If you identify that frustration, put it into
words and verbally offer to solve it along with the original problem then you
bond with your customer because you’ve positioned yourself more deeply into
their internal narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophical problems</strong> are important because people want to be involved in
something larger than themselves. It adds depth and meaning. Representing (and
solving) a philosophical problem gives customers a way of expressing their
values that they wouldn’t otherwise have.</p>
<p>If you can <strong>resolve all three problems in one shot</strong>, then the audience experiences
a wave of relief and pleasure, and they will love the story. Like when Anakin
Skywalker blows up the Deathstar by aiming the perfect shot, he defeats the
external problem (the enemy army), his internal problem (no more self doubt) and
the philosophical problem (justice is served)</p>
<p><strong> Frame your <span class="caps">CTA</span> as the action that must be taken to close the final story gap</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a <strong>single villain</strong> that your brand stands against?</li>
<li>What <strong>external problem</strong> is that villain causing?</li>
<li>How is the external problem making your customer feel?</li>
<li>Why is it unjust for people to suffer because of that villain?</li>
</ol>
<p>Our hero is being challenged - will they be able to solve their problem? The
only way to find out is to engage with the brand.</p>
<h1 id="guide">Guide</h1>
<p>Customers aren’t looking for another hero, they’re looking for a guide who can
help them.</p>
<p>A persons life is made up of many acts - doorways of no return. And whilst each
life is unique, we all have common chapters. We are all on transformational
journeys with common elements. In stories, events mark the beginning and end of
chapters. In stories, these events are instigated by external actors called guides.</p>
<p>Heroes need a guide who is <strong>trustworthy</strong> and earns <strong>respect</strong>. If they didn’t
need a hero their wouldn’t be a story. Everyone is looking for a guide to help
them solve their problems.</p>
<p><em>Just like in stories, humans wake up each morning self-identifying as a hero.
They are troubled by internal, external and philosophical issues. And they know
they can’t solve their issues on their own.</em></p>
<p>This insight has consequences, it means the story isn’t about us but about
others. We can aspire to be guides for others, but not the hero to others. It
shows why the search for meaning is innate, but can only be resolved by
unbecoming a hero. Stop losing sleep over the success of your company and start
losing sleep over the success of your customers.</p>
<p>In stories, heroes are not the strongest characters, they have self-doubt and are
often ill-equipped. They are often reluctant, and are thrown into the story by
outside events.</p>
<p>The guide has already “been there and done that” and has conquered the hero’s
internal and philosophical challenges in their own backstory.</p>
<p>The guide is the one with authority. Much more authority than the hero. But the
main character is the hero.</p>
<p>Those who realize that the epic story of life is not about them end up winning
in the end. This is paradoxical. Those who think they are a hero and win usually
end up being remembered as a villain.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of a guide</h3>
<p>Empathy and Authority are a precise one-two punch.</p>
<h4>1. Empathy</h4>
<p>When we empathise with customers we show that we understand them, and
understanding produces trust.</p>
<p>People want to be <em>seen, heard and understood</em>. This is the essence of empathy.</p>
<p><em>we understand how it feels to …</em><br/>
<em>no-one should have to experience …</em><br/>
<em>like you, we are frustrated by …</em></p>
<p>Expressing empathy isn’t difficult. Once you’ve identified your customers
internal problem, let them know that you understand and would like to help them
find a resolution.</p>
<p>Brains like to conserve calories, energy, effort, time, so when a customer
realises they have a lot in common with a brand, they fill in any gaps with
trust. A customer will “batch” their thoughts, which means they are thinking in
chunks rather than in details. Commonality, whether in music taste or values, is
a powerful marketing tool.</p>
<h4>2. Authority</h4>
<p>No one likes a know-it-all and no one wants to be preached at… But people <em>do</em>
want you to establish <strong>competence</strong>.</p>
<p>When looking for a guide, a hero trusts someone who has <em>demonstrable competence</em>.</p>
<p>The guide should have some serious experience helping other heroes win their day.</p>
<p>The guide doesn’t need to be perfect.</p>
<p>There are four ways to add authority (competence) to your marketing without
being arrogant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Logos</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Awards</li>
</ol>
<h4>A good first impression</h4>
<p>Meeting a brand is like meeting a person,</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you help them live a <strong>better life</strong>?</li>
<li>Can they <strong>associate their identity</strong> with your brand?</li>
<li>Can I <strong>respect</strong> this brand?</li>
<li>Can I <strong>trust</strong> this brand?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="plan">Plan</h1>
<p>The story was started be identifying something that the hero wants.<br/>
Then intrigue was created by defining their problem. The audience want to know
if we can help them overcome their problem.
Then we introduced ourself as the guide, and established authority and empathy
and trust.</p>
<p>Making a purchase is a characteristic of a committed relationship. The
commitment means there is a potential downside, they could waste their time and
money and feel foolish.</p>
<p>Imagine a customer trying to cross a river to get to their purchase. They can
hear the sound of a waterfall downstream. If they try to cross, by making a
purchase, there is a chance that something bad could happen. Put stones in the
river so they know how to cross, step by step.</p>
<p>The stones are the plan.</p>
<p>In a movie, the guide gives the hero a plan. The plan tightens the focus of
the movie and creates a “path of hope” for the hero that might, possibly, lead
to the resolution of the hero’s problems. It creates a story gap.</p>
<p>All effective plans do one of two things:  </p>
<ol>
<li>remove a sense of risk</li>
<li>clarify how to do business</li>
</ol>
<p>If we don’t guide customers, they experience a little bit of confusion and use
that confusion as an excuse to not purchase.</p>
<p>Even though the setup or purchase or after-purchase steps are obvious to us,
they are not obvious to customers. Give them a plan and they will feel more
confident about purchasing.</p>
<h3>Process Plan</h3>
<p>The minimal (3 - 6) steps required to buy <em>or</em> get benefit from the
product after purchase, or a mixture of both. E.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make an appointment.</li>
<li>Allow us to create a customized plan.</li>
<li>Let’s execute the plan together.</li>
</ol>
<p>A process plan removes confusion from the customers journey. When they see the
plan they think “oh that’s not difficult, I can do that” and then they purchase.</p>
<p>A post-purchase process plan would alleviate confusion about how the customer
would <em>use</em> the product.</p>
<h3>Agreement Plan</h3>
<p>Agreement plans are about alleviating fears. It’s a list of agreements you make
with the customer that are designed to alleviate their fears of doing business
with you.</p>
<p>An agreement plan can also work to highlight shared values.</p>
<p>Give the agreement plan a good name and it can increase the perceived value of
your product. “the easy-installation plan”, “your best nights sleep ever”, etc.</p>
<p>Agreement plans can work in the background, they don’t have to be on the landing
page, though they could be.</p>
<p>Make an agreement plan by creating a list of all the things a customer could be
fearful about when doing business with you (haggling for price, interacting with
a pushy salesman, buying a lemon/defective product) and then create an promise
that would nullify that fear.</p>
<p>Customers want to know where you can take them. Unless you can take them
somewhere they want to go, why would they listen?</p>
<p>The marketing goal is that every potential customer knows where we want to take
them. Define a desire for your customer, and your marketing story will have a
powerful hook.</p>
<p>Heroes trust a guide who has a plan.</p>
<p>People are looking for a philosophy then can embody, or a series of steps they
can take to solve their problems.</p>
<h3>Two kinds of plan</h3>
<ul>
<li>Agreement Plan</li>
<li>Process Plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types work by earning trust and offer the custom a clear path to stability.</p>
<h1 id="a-call-to-action">A Call To Action</h1>
<p>So far, we’ve defined a <strong>desire</strong>, identified their <strong>challenges</strong>,
<strong>empathized</strong> with them, established our <strong>competency</strong> and given them a
<strong>plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In stories, characters never take action on their own, there is always an
outside force (the guide) challenges them to make a change.</p>
<p>Heroes need to be challenged by external forces. Calls to action should be
clear, and should be repeated over and over. Above the fold, in the center of
the page. Also in the navbar. And also repeatedly as they scroll down the page.</p>
<p>Customers are bombarded with adverts and calls-to-action all day every day. They
are ignoring things and filtering out noise all the time. So don’t be shy or
subtle. Be very clear. Make it very simple. If you have confidence in your
product, make confident calls to action.</p>
<h3>Direct Calls</h3>
<ul>
<li>buy now</li>
<li>schedule an appointment</li>
<li>order now</li>
<li>call today</li>
<li>Register today</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat the same (singular, simple) call to action again and again down the page.</p>
<h3>Transitional Calls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download our free <span class="caps">PDF</span> guide to growing your business</li>
<li>Free information - advice, guides, whitepapers, reports</li>
<li>Giving something away for free</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Samples</li>
<li>Free-trials</li>
</ul>
<p>A good transitional <span class="caps">CTA</span> does three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish expertise and authority, and positions you as a leader</li>
<li>Create reciprocity</li>
<li>Positions you as a guide</li>
</ol>
<p>Use both kinds in your messaging, and customers will understand (without burning
calories) what you (the guide) want them to do (the plan) to solve their problem.</p>
<p>Heroes don’t take action by themselves, they <em>must</em> be challenged. It’s just not
interesting if the hero can solve their own problems without an externality,
this is just how stories (and humans) work.</p>
<p><strong>Characters only take action when challenged by an outside force.</strong></p>
<h1 id="what-is-at-stake">What is at stake?</h1>
<p>Stories live and die by a single question; “What is at stake?” If nothing can be
gained or lost then nobody cares. If there is nothing at stake in the story then
there is no story, it’s just not interesting.</p>
<p>If there is no benefit to buying the product, then why buy it?</p>
<p>You have to show the customer the cost of <em>not buying</em> the product.</p>
<h1 id="avoid-failure">Avoid Failure</h1>
<p>The story remains intersting as long as the hero is teeting on the edge between
success and failure. A hero in a story only ever has 2 motivations - to escape
pain or experience something good. Life is like that too, our desire to avoid
pain motivates us to make a change.</p>
<p>There needs to be meaninful consequential stakes in the story, otherwise it isnt
interesting. Each scene needs to move the hero either closer to or further from
their tragic external threat.</p>
<p>A brand needs to answer the “what if I don’t buy” question because otherwise the
customer can ask “so what?” - the stakes need to be clearly, simply, concisely
communicated. Probably stake, not stakes.</p>
<p>You can do it humorously. and only lights - it is salt to add flavor, not a
main-serving of fear. Compare the fear to the peace and stability that could be
achieved. If you show the pain “before” and contrast it to peace and stability
“after” then you’ve also opened and closed a story loop.</p>
<p>Blog titles, email subjects, headlines, can all contain elements of potential
failure to convey a sense of urgency. Bring up the negative stakes a bit.</p>
<p>People fear losing \<span class="math">\(100 more than they desire gaining \\)</span>100 - loss and pain is
more motivating than reward and peace.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let the reader know they are vulnerable to a threat. “X% of Y get W”</li>
<li>Let the reader know that since they <em>are</em> vulnerable, they should take action
   to reduce their vulnerability. “Make sure this doesnt happen and protect yourself”</li>
<li>Give the customer a clear, concise simple plan to reduce their
   vulnerability. “We offer the thing you need”</li>
<li>Challenge people to take the next step right now. the <span class="caps">CTA</span>. “Call us today to
   arrange an appointment”</li>
</ol>
<p>Agitate a bit of fear, and then return the reader to peace and prosperity, all
within 1 or 2 paragraphs.</p>
<p><em>What are you helping your customers avoid?</em></p>
<p>It’s only a little salt to add flavor. If its too little, customers wont know
why your product is important. If its too strong it’ll be off-putting.</p>
<h1 id="end-with-success">End with Success</h1>
<p>People want to change their lives and be taken into a new reality. Tell them how
their lives are going to improve - peace, status, confidence, abilities, preparedness.</p>
<p>People want a vision of a happy ending.</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>We’re going to put a man on the moon”</em> vs <em>“We would like a highly competitive and successful space program”</em></p>
<p>Answer each of these questions with a “before your brand” column and an “after your brand” column:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do they have?</li>
<li>What are they feeling?</li>
<li>What’s an average day like?</li>
<li>What is their status?</li>
</ol>
<p>This will show you how your customers lives will change and give lots of good
copy for your marketing.</p>
<p>Talk about the end vision really clearly. And use images of
happy/successful/powerful people enjoying the benefits of your product. Say the
benefits loudly, confidently, clearly, simply, repeatedly.</p>
<p>Talk about your end-vision for their lives once theyve benefited from your service.</p>
<p>Show the customer a vision of how great their life will be if they do business
with you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the end of the story should be a list of resolutions to your
customers problems. How do they feel and how have philosophical/justice
questions been resolved?</p>
<p>Stories usually end in 1 of three ways:
1. The hero gains some status or power
    * Offer access - get a free coffee.
    * Offer a premium - skip the line.
    * Create scarcity - write “limited” on it.
    * Identity association - wear a Rolex and be associated with what Rolex stands for.
2. The hero has become unified with someone that makes them whole
    * The hero needed something they couldn’t get themselves, and external provision has saved them.
    * Reduced anxiety.
    * Reduces effort.
    * More time.
3. The hero has some internal realisation (coming of age) that gives them
   confidence to overcome their shortcomings and become “whole” and wise.
   They can achieve inner-peace and know that they have reached their potential
    * inspiration - chariots of fire - you can also run really fast
    * acceptance - fashion brands doing positive body image
    * transcendence - greater purpose and meaning - fair-trade coffee</p>
<p>Humans are looking for resolution to their external, internal and philosophical
problems. They can achieve this though (among other things) status,
self-realization, self-acceptance, and transcendence.</p>
<p>If you product or service can help people achieve this then it should be a
central part of your brand promise.</p>
<h1 id="people-want-your-brand-to-participate-in-their-transformation">People want your brand to participate in their transformation</h1>
<p>They are looking for a guide. Everybody wants to change either into someone
better or someone more self-accepting. You are helping them become wiser,
fitter, more equipped, accepted or peaceful.</p>
<p>What does the customer want to become? What is their aspirational identity? What
kind of person do they want to be? How do they want their friends to talk about them?</p>
<p>Readers needs to be told very clearly how much the hero has changed and how far
they’ve come. Usually, the hero is deeply flawed right up until the final
climactic scene.</p>
<p>A hero needs someone else to step into their life, tell them they are different
and special and better. That someone is a guide, that’s you.</p>
<p>Offering an aspirational identity to our customers adds a lot of value to our
products and services. Realise that your customers want to transform and improve themselves.</p>
<p>Not all elements of a story should be used evenly.</p>
